As expounded across several interwoven MCU multimedia titles, the six Infinity Stones are reputed to embody and control essential aspects of existence—Space, Mind, Reality, Power, Time, and Soul—thereby making them critical artifacts in the MCU and, together, theMacGuffinof the dedicatedInfinity Saga.\n\nThe Stones, with the exception of the Soul Stone, made their debuts in films leading up toAvengers: Infinity War(2018). The Space Stone, the first Stone to appear, was featured in apost-credit sceneforThor(2011), housed within the Tesseract. The Stone / Tesseract established its significance in the MCU through the antecedent films,Captain America: The First Avenger(2011) andThe Avengers(2012). InThe First Avenger, theRed Skullused the power of the Stone to powerHydra's weaponry duringWorld War II. InThe Avengers,Lokiwas sent to Earth byThanosto get the Stone fromS.H.I.E.L.D.The Space Stone did not make another appearance untilPhase Three, when it made a minor appearance inThor: Ragnarok(2017) and played a major role inCaptain Marvel(2019) when it was revealed that the Stone gaveCarol Danversher powers. The Mind Stone first showed up inThe Avengers, housed in asceptergiven to Loki in his efforts to get the Space Stone from Earth. The Stone returned within the scepter inAvengers: Age of Ultron(2015) where it was being used on human test subjects. The Mind Stone was eventually used to giveVisionlife.\n\nThor: The Dark World(2013) introduced the Reality Stone in its liquid form known as the Aether. It temporarily infectedJane Fosterbefore it was given toThe Collectorto keep it separate from the Space Stone. The Power and Time Stones made their debuts inGuardians of the Galaxy(2014) andDoctor Strange(2016) respectively.Ronan the Accuserseeks out the Power Stone for Thanos, but he is defeated by theGuardians of the Galaxy, who entrust the Stone with theNova Corps.Stephen Strangefinds the Eye of Agamotto, which houses the Time Stone, and uses it to save Earth from the demon,Dormammu. The Soul Stone was the last Stone to make an appearance, first showing up inInfinity Warwhen Thanos collects the Stone onVormirafter sacrificingGamora.\n\nThanos sets out to collect all six Stones to use them to wipe out half of all life in the universe, believing that his plan will save it from extinction. In 2018, Thanos accomplishes his goal and snaps his fingers while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet containing the Stones, causingthe Blip. Thanos eventually uses the Stones again to destroy them and five years later,  the survivingAvengersform a plan to go back in time to collect the Stones from other time periods to undo Thanos' snap. After defeating Thanos and undoing his actions from 2018,Steve Rogers / Captain Americareturns the Stones to the exact moments in time that the Avengers collected them from.\n\nDespite being destroyed, the Stones make appearances in theMultiverse Saga, including inDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness(2022) inan alternate universewhere Thanos was defeated on his home planet ofTitanby theIlluminatibefore he can collect all of the Stones. They also make appearances in several of the MCU television series onDisney+, between flashbacks inWandaVision(2021) and alternate universes in the first season ofLoki(2021) and the animated seriesWhat If...?(2021–24). Scientific studies relating to the Stones have been conducted, mostly since the release ofInfinity War, including one focusing on the control of matter.\n\nThe stories of the Stones in the MCU take place in theEarth-616universe.[a]The fictional information below includes events that happened with the Stones from more than one Earth-616 timeline, as well as events that happened with them in multiple otheruniverses.\n\nIn 2014, theCollectorexplains that the Infinity Stones are the remnants of sixsingularitiesthat existed before theBig Bang, which were compressed into Stones by cosmic entities after the universe began and which were dispersed throughout the cosmos.[3][4]Four years later, it is further explained byWongandStephen Strangethat each Infinity Stone embodies and controls an essential aspect of existence.[5]\n\nIn 1942, theRed Skullsteals the Tesseract, which contains the Space Stone, from a church and uses it to powerHydra's weaponry duringWorld War II. DuringSteve Rogers's final fight against Red Skull,[6]the Tesseract transports the latter to the planetVormir.[5]Afterwards, the Tesseract falls into the Arctic Ocean, where it is later recovered byHoward Starkand taken to a secret base.[6]\n\nDr.Wendy Lawsonunsuccessfully tries to use the Tesseract in 1989 to unlock light-speed travel to help theSkrullsfind a new home. However, her experiments result inCarol Danversbeing granted superhuman strength, flight, and the ability to generate energy blasts. Danvers eventually recovers the Tesseract and hands the object over toS.H.I.E.L.D., but it is temporarily swallowed by aFlerkennamedGoose, who later vomits it out onNick Fury's desk.[7]\n\nIn 2012, Fury shows the Tesseract to Dr.Erik Selvig, when the Tesseract suddenly opens a portal allowing forLokito come through.[8][9]Loki steals the Tesseract and later opens awormhole, using it to transport theChitauriarmy to New York City in an attempt to conquer Earth. After theAvengersrepel the invasion, Thor returns the Tesseract toAsgardfor safekeeping in Odin's vault, and it is used to repair theBifrost.[9][10]Years later, the Asgardian prophecy of its destruction by the fire demonSurturcomes true. Loki takes the Tesseract from the vault before escaping.[11][12]\n\nThe Stone is originally housed in asceptergiven to Loki byThanosandthe Otherto help locate the Tesseract and conquer Earth with its ability to control people's minds and project energy blasts.[9][13]After Loki's defeat, it falls into the hands of Hydra leader BaronWolfgang von Strucker, who uses it to experiment on people, including siblingsPietroandWanda Maximoff, who are the only surviving subjects of Strucker's experiments.[14][15]Von Strucker's experiments cause Pietro to gain superhuman abilities and amplify Wanda's powers.[15][16]Strucker's base is attacked by the Avengers, who take back the scepter. The Avengers discover that it contains the Mind Stone, which itself contains an artificial intelligence that grants sentience to the computer program Ultron, who steals the scepter and removes the Stone to create a newly upgraded body. The Avengers steal the Mind Stone–infused body from Ultron and upload the A.I.J.A.R.V.I.S.into it, giving birth to the androidVision.[10][13][15]\n\nEons ago,Malekithattempts to use the Reality Stone, appearing in its fluid-like weapon state called the Aether, to destroy theNine Realms. His plan was to return the universe to its pre-Big Bang state, only to be thwarted byBor, who had it hidden. In 2013,Jane Fosterbecomes infected by the Aether after coming across its resting place, though Malekith later draws it out of her. After Malekith is defeated byThor,SifandVolstagg, they seal the Aether in a lantern-like container and entrust it to the Collector to keep it separate from the Tesseract, as the three of them consider it unwise to have multiple Infinity Stones close to each other.[10][17][18][19]The Aether, once bonded to a host, can turn anything into dark matter as well as suck the life force out of humans and other mortals. The Aether can also disrupt the laws of physics and repel threats if it senses any.[1][17]\n\nHoused in the Orb hidden on the planetMorag, the Power Stone is capable of increasing the user's strength and destroying entire civilizations with a single blast. However, the Stone is too much for most mortal beings to physically handle because its power will destroy them on contact.[20][21]In 2014,Ronan the Accuserseeks the Orb for Thanos, butPeter Quillfinds and steals the Orb from Morag's resting spot beforeKorathcan. Ronan eventually steals it from the Guardians. After learning about the Power Stone, however, Ronan betrays Thanos and tries to use its destructive power to destroy the planetXandar. During the battle to protect Xandar, by sharing the burden of the Power Stone's energy, the Guardians are able to use it to kill Ronan. It is later revealed that Peter Quill's half-Celestial physiology allowed him to withstand the Stone's power on his own for a brief time before the other Guardians joined him. They seal the Power Stone in a new Orb and entrust it to theNova Corpsfor safekeeping.[3][10]\n\nIn 2016, Dr.Stephen Strangefinds the Eye of Agamotto, which houses the Time Stone, and learns how to use it to save the Earth fromDormammuby trapping him in atime loopuntil the demon abandons his plans for Earth. Strange returns the Eye of Agamotto to the Masters of the Mystic Arts' secret compoundKamar-Tajin Kathmandu, Nepal, but soon begins wearing it again.[11][22][23]\n\nAn object that has the ability to manipulate the soul and essence of a person,[2]control life and death, and contains a pocket dimension called theSoul World.[24]At some time in the past, Thanos tasksGamorato find the Soul Stone, as there is little record of its existence compared to the other Infinity Stones. Gamora finds a map leading to where it was hidden: in a shrine on the planet Vormir, but chooses to destroy the map and not tell Thanos, only telling Nebula of it and swearing her to secrecy, unaware that Thanos wasn't fooled by their lies.[5]\n\nThanos begins his quest to collect all six Stones by decimating Xandar to obtain the Power Stone. He then tracks down the Space Stone and intercepts the Asgardian ship on its way to Earth after the destruction of Asgard.[11][25]Thanos kills half of the occupants and threatens to kill Thor as well, but Loki gives up the Tesseract to save his brother's life. Thanos proceeds to crush the Tesseract to acquire the Space Stone. He tellshis childrento acquire the two Stones on Earth. He then uses the Power Stone to destroy the ship as he teleports his children and himself away with the Space Stone.[5]\n\nThanos' four children split up, with two looking to collect the Time Stone from Strange and the other two going after Vision for the Mind Stone. In New York,Ebony MawandCull Obsidianattempt to steal the Time Stone from Strange, but are foiled by Stark, Parker, and Wong. Strange is teleported up to Maw's ship with Stark and Parker sneaking on board. In Edinburgh, Vision is injured byProxima MidnightandCorvus Glaivein their attempts to get the Stone from his head. After the pair are defeated, Vision is taken to Wakanda to have the Stone removed byShuri, in the hope that Vision would be able to live without it.[5]\n\nWhile his children are on Earth, Thanos acquires the Aether from the Collector onKnowhereand turns it back into the Reality Stone, allowing for him to repel theGuardians of the Galaxy's attacks by turningDraxto rocks,Mantisinto ribbon strips, and causing Peter Quill's gun to shoot bubbles. Thanos then teleportsGamoraand himself back to his ship, where he is keeping a capturedNebula. He uses the Power Stone to torture her in front of Gamora, forcing Gamora to agree to take him to Vormir to find the Soul Stone. On Vormir, they encounter the Stone keeper, Red Skull. Thanos reluctantly sacrifices Gamora to fulfill the requirements to obtain the Soul Stone once the Red Skull explains to them that the Stone requires the sacrifice of a loved one to earn it.[26][27]\n\nMaw gets sucked out of an airlock and his ship takes Stark, Strange, and Parker toTitan, Thanos' home planet, where they run into Quill, Drax, and Mantis. Before Thanos arrives, Strange uses the Time Stone to look into future timelines and viewing millions of possible outcomes of their conflict, learning of only one future in which they win. Thanos arrives expecting Maw, and fights the Avengers and Guardians using the Stones. He defeats them all, leading Strange to surrender the Time Stone to prevent Thanos from killing Stark to ensure the winning future comes to pass.[5]\n\nThanos' remaining children arrive in Wakanda where Shuri is unable to complete the removal of the Mind Stone from Vision's head before she is attacked by Glaive. Thanos arrives looking to get the Stone himself, using some of the Stones against the Avengers and Wakandans trying to fight him off. As a result of the Stone still being in Vision's head, Wanda is forced to destroy Vision and the Stone to try to prevent Thanos from getting it, only for Thanos to use the Time Stone to repair them both and collect the latter. Thanos uses all of the Stones to initiatethe Blip, where he is briefly transported into the Soul World and encounters a vision of a young Gamora.[28]He then teleports away with the Space Stone to theGarden. Thanos uses the Stones to destroy them to prevent further use in the future.[5][29][30]\n\nAfterScott Langis freed from theQuantum Realmfive years after the Blip,[31]he goes to the Avengers Compound and brings up the idea of atime heistusing the Quantum Realm to collect each Stone from different points in time as changing the past does not change the future and instead creates alternate timelines. The surviving Avengers split up into teams to each focus on one Stone.[29]\n\nRogers, Stark, Lang, and Banner travel to an alternate 2012, where the Space, Mind, and Time Stones are all located. Stark and Lang attempt to steal the alternate 2012 Tesseract, but the alternate 2012 Hulk accidentally knocks Stark down and the 2012 Tesseract is taken by the alternate 2012 Loki, who uses it to open a wormhole and escape. Rogers retrieves the scepter containing the 2012 Mind Stone, using it to render his alternate 2012 self unconscious after he mistook him for a disguised Loki. Banner convinces theAncient Oneto relinquish that timeline's Time Stone, promising to return it after they are done using it to ensure that the alternate timelines will survive. After failing to retrieve the 2012 Space Stone, Stark and Rogers travel to an alternate 1970 and take the alternate 1970 Tesseract fromCamp Lehigh, New Jerseyand use a stolen briefcase to smuggle it out.[29]\n\nThor andRockettravel back to Asgard in an alternate 2013 to extract the alternate 2013 Aether from the alternate 2013 Jane Foster.James RhodesandNebulatravel back to Morag in an alternate 2014, subduing the alternate 2014 Peter Quill before taking the 2014 Power Stone in its Orb. Romanoff andClint Bartontravel to Vormir in an alternate 2014, where each attempts to sacrifice themselves to allow the other to return with the Stone, ultimately ending with Romanoff sacrificing herself.[29]\n\nAll of the Stones are brought back to the present day and removed from their containers while the 2013 Aether is turned into its solid state. Stark creates aNano Gauntletto house the Stones, which Banner uses to undo the Blip. An alternate 2014 Thanos, having been alerted by their actions due to Nebula's cybernetic systems connecting with her alternate 2014 self, brings his army to the future, destroying the compound and intending to use the Stones to destroy and recreate the universe out of revenge for the Blip being undone, but is ultimately defeated when Stark sacrifices himself to disintegrate Thanos and his army with the Stones in the Nano Gauntlet. After Stark's funeral, Rogers returns all of the past Stones to the points in time that they were collected from, although without the Tesseract, scepter, Orb, and with the Reality Stone still in its solid form.[29]\n\nThree weeks after Thanos' snap is undone, a still grieving Wanda Maximoff uses her connection with the Mind Stone to reanimate a fake Vision. Later on,Agatha Harknessshows Maximoff various points in her past, including the moment of Hydra's experimentation with the Stone on her. Maximoff learns that the exposure to the Stone tapped into and amplifyed her innate magic, as well as giving her a prophetic vision of her as the Scarlet Witch.[16][32]\n\nOther versions of the Stones are depicted in the alternate realities of the MCU multiverse.\n\nAn alternate 2012 Loki, who escaped during the Avengers' attempt to collect all the Infinity Stones to undo Thanos' actions,[29]has the alternate 2012 Tesseract confiscated by theTime Variance Authority(TVA). Later, Loki tries to retrieve the Tesseract only to find that it is powerless in the TVA, along with all the other Stones, in which the TVA has captured dozens of each from other timelines.[33][34]The Stones are used as paperweights in the TVA, as such thefounderof the TVA and his severalKang the Conquerorvariantsare more powerful than the Stones.[35]\n\nIn analternate version of World War II, Howard Stark uses the confiscated Tesseract as the power source for theHydra Stomper.[36]Inanother universe,T'Challa, rather than Peter Quill, finds the Power Stone on Morag.[37]Inan alternate version of 2016, Stephen Strange attempts to use the Time Stone to prevent the death ofChristine Palmer, only to find her death is an absolute point in his universe, meaning no matter what he does, she's destined to die, despite his countless attempts to avert the scenario. It becomes the only Stone left in existence in his universe due to his subsequent actions.[38]\n\nAsone universe suffers from a quantum zombie outbreak, Vision discovers that his Mind Stone can be used to cure the infected. However, it is unable to cure the infected Maximoff, due to her powers coming from the Stone, prompting Vision to initially try and feed other survivors to Maximoff to keep her calm until he can properly cure her.[39]When other heroes find him, Vision accepts that his actions are wrong and he gives the Stone to the surviving heroes to take to Wakanda, sacrificing himself out of guilt. However, a zombified Thanos arrives in Wakanda, possessing the other five Infinity Stones in his Gauntlet.[40]\n\nIn another scenario, Thanos once again arrives on Earth with five Stones, only to discover thatthe Avengers lost to Ultron, who is in possession of Vision's vibranium body and the Mind Stone. Ultron kills Thanos and takes the Stones for himself, using them to conquer and destroy his universe. When this task is complete, Ultron attains a higher level of consciousness and uses the Stones to travel into other dimensions and duelthe Watcher.[41]To stop Infinity Ultron expanding into other universes, the Watcher assembles theGuardians of the Multiverse, a team of heroes from various alternate realities, including Strange Supreme, and gifts them a weapon to destroy the Stones called the Infinity Crusher. When the Crusher fails due to it being designed to only work for the Stones in its respective universe, the heroes kill Ultron by uploadingArnim Zola's analog consciousness into his body. The Stones are nearly taken byKillmonger, but he is stopped by Zola, who tries to take the Stones for himself. Strange Supreme and the Watcher imprison them along with the Stones in a pocket dimension, frozen outside of time so that neither they nor the Stones from Ultron's universe can be a threat anymore.[42]\n\nInKahhori's universe, the Tesseract crashes into a lake in pre-colonial America after survivingRagnorokand breaks, releasing unmitigated Space Stone energy into the lake's waters. As a result, a portal opens to another dimension called the Sky World, granting the inhabitants of that world incredible powers.[43]After getting transported into a dying universe in the year 1602, Captain Carter, with the help of Tony Stark, discovers a device powered by the Time Stone that had been caused when Steve Rogers, while fighting Thanos during the Battle of Wakanda, accidentally hit the Time Stone with one of his shields. Using Stark's device and the Time Stone, Carter and Rogers are able to set things right, returning Rogers to his own time and ending the temporal anomaly that was tearing apart the world.[44]Among Doctor Strange Supreme's prisoners that are released by Captain Carter is a Thanos with a completed Infinity Gauntlet. However, having been freed by Carter, Killmonger (who won the battle against Zola) disintegrates Thanos with his own set of Infinity Stones. Kahhori is able to use her Tesseract-granted powers to separate Killmonger from his Infinity Armor and teleport him away, allowing Carter to take the Infinity Stones for herself. Carter is able to wield the Infinity Stones against Strange alongside Hela's crown and the weapons of some of the freed prisoners. By punching Strange with the Infinity Stones, Carter manages to bring him back to his senses temporarily.[45]\n\nIn the last two episodes of season three, another set of Infinity Stones is seen wielded by an alternate version of Infinity Ultron, who had succeeded in destroying all life in his universe, but was left with no purpose. Carter requests for his help to rescue the Watcher before she is captured by the Eminence. Kahhori, Byrdie, and Storm later do the same, and Infinity Ultron agrees to help rescue Carter and the Watcher. During the battle against the Eminence, Incarnate, and Executioner, he sacrifices himself to allow the others to escape.\n\nOnEarth-838, theIlluminatifought against Thanos on Titan who was in possession of five Infinity Stones. They killed him, leaving the gauntlet and the Stones in their responsibility.[46]\n\nTwo variants of the Reality and Time Stones are shown to be embedded in a sling ring Cassandra Nova had taken from an unidentified variant of Stephen Strange. This allows her to open a portal from the Void to Earth-10005 and allow Deadpool and Wolverine to return to it. She later uses it to send the Deadpool Corps to that timeline to keep them from reaching her.\n\nThe Infinity Gauntlet is a left handed metalGauntletused to house the six Stones. A right-handed Gauntlet appears inThor(2011), where it's stored inOdin's vault,[10]though this one was later revealed to be a fake byHelainThor: Ragnarok.[47]The mid-credits scene ofAvengers: Age of Ultron(2015) revealed Thanos had acquired a left-handed Infinity Gauntlet.[15][48]InInfinity War, it is revealedThanosinvadedNidavellirand forcedEitrito create the Infinity Gauntlet by threatening to kill his people, though he did so anyway once it was completed, as well as removing Eitri's hands to prevent his making of anything else.[49]After obtaining all six Infinity Stones, Thanos snaps his fingers in the Gauntlet and erases half of all life in the universe.\n\nInEndgame, the Gauntlet is revealed to be burnt and permanently bound to Thanos' swollen arm. After Thor kills Thanos, the charred damaged Gauntlet is left abandoned on the Garden planet. Five years later, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, and Rocket usenanotechnologyto create a right-handed Nano Gauntlet to use the alternate universe versions of the Infinity Stones. Banner in his \"Smart Hulk\" form, due to being the most immune to the gamma radiation that the Infinity Stones' combined powers emit, uses the Nano Gauntlet to reverse the Blip. However, the strain of channeling the combined powers still causes him considerable pain and leaves him with a crippled right arm. During the battle at the Avengers Compound, an alternate variant of Thanos from 2014 attempts to use the Nano Gauntlet. Although he successfully acquires it, Stark magnetically removes the Stones from the Nano Gauntlet and, wielding a makeshift Gauntlet formed within his armor, uses them to erase Thanos, his army, and the Nano Gauntlet. \nThe original Gauntlet appears in flashback sequences fromInfinity WarinWandaVision(2021).\n\nAlternate versions of the Infinity Gauntlet made brief appearances inWhat If...?, first in the fifth episode, when a zombified Thanos shows up inWakanda,[40]: 27:51–27:59and the eighth episode when Thanos arrives on Earth but is swiftly killed byUltron.[41]: 6:20–6:30The Gauntlet returns in a small capacity during thesecond seasonofWhat If...?, appearing in the last two episodes. In theseason's penultimate episode, Steve Rogers unwillingly strikes the Time Stone while fighting Thanos and in thefinal episodewhere the Gauntlet is used by another version of Thanos, who is then killed by Killmonger.[44][45]A Gauntlet appears in a flashback sequence inDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness(2022) after Thanos is killed onTitanby theIlluminati.[50][51]\n\nThe Infinity Stones played a big role in theMarvel Cinematic Universe'sInfinity Saga, but they were not the original story plan. Despite the Space Stone being introduced inThor, and the Mind Stone and Thanos debuting inThe Avengers, there were no official plans until at least 2012 to make the Stones theMacGuffinsof the Saga.James Gunnrevealed that it wasn't until after he completed his first draft forGuardians of the Galaxy(2014) thatMarvel Studiosdecided to put a bigger focus on the Stones moving forward.[53]Gunn revealed during the press tour forGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3(2023) that he wrote the scene introducing the Stones' backstory in an hour and a half starting with thePower Stonebeing in possession of the Collector at the time.[52]The Power Stone's color had to be changed from red like it is in the comics, to purple in the middle of development onGuardians of the Galaxybecause Marvel decided that the Aether was going to be the Reality Stone.[53][54]\n\nIn the comics, Thanos is motivated to retrieve and use theInfinity Gemsto impressLady Deathas she believed that the universe was overpopulated and headed for mass extinction. In the films, there is no mention of Lady Death, and Thanos wishes to reduce the population to avoid a repeat of his experience on Titan.[55]Thanos retrieved each gem from a being who held it at the time. TheIn-Betweenerhad the Soul Gem, theChampion of the Universehad the Power Gem, theGardenerhad the Time Gem, theCollectorhad the Reality Gem, theRunnerhad the Space Gem, and theGrandmasterhad the Mind Gem. Furthermore, nobody else was even aware of Thanos, therefore no one attempted to stop him.[56]\n\nIn the comics, the gems had other rules, and simply being in possession of one wasn't good enough. Each gem was powered by mastering a primordial force characterized by one of the other gems. For example, mastering the Power Gem was dependent on the user's mastery of the mind, while mastery of the soul correlated with the power of the Mind Gem.[57]The colors of the stones were originally different in the comics. They were purple for Space, yellow for Reality, red for Power, blue for Mind, orange for Time, and green for Soul.[58]The stone colors were updated in theMarvel Legacyseries to match the film versions.[59]In the MCU, the Time Stone is housed in the Eye of Agamotto and the Space Stone is housed in the Tesseract. However, the Marvel Comics versions of these two stones have no connections to these relics.[60][61]\n\nThe existence of the Infinity Stones in the MCU has been described as the \"one driving force that unifies all the robot-alien-hero fighting\" byThe Verge.[58]The use of the Infinity Stones as a plot device led to fan speculation as to the location of as-yet undiscovered Stones, and the possible appearance of additional Stones. One theory popular with fans was that words describing the nature or location of the Stones spelled out the name \"THANOS\", and that the as-yet undiscovered Soul Stone was somehow associated with the characterHeimdall.[58]Another theory proposed prior to the release ofEndgamewas that it would involve a seventh Infinity Stone corresponding to an additional Infinity Gem from the comics, the Ego Stone.[62]\n\nCharles Pulliam-Moore ofGizmodothought that the Soul Stone was the least interesting Stone because unlike the others, it was never given a chance to show why it can be formidable on its own like the other Stones had a chance to do in previous MCU films. However, during theInfinity Wardirectors commentary, they confirmed that the Stone has some of the elements of its comic counterpart including \"conjuring the spiritual representations of the dead on another plane of existence\".[63]\n\nAtSan Diego Comic-Conin 2022, Marvel and East Continental Gems announced the Infinity Collection of Gemstones, a set of six Gem stones representing each Stone and displayed in an Infinity Gauntlet created by Gentle Giant Ltd. All six gems combined are over 150caratsand valued atUSD$25 million. Each Stone is represented by different gems: The Time Stone is a Colombianemeraldnearing 23 carats, the Space Stone is asapphirefrom Madagascar, with over 30 carats, the Reality Stone is a naturalrubyfrom Mozambique, Africa with over 15 carats, the Power Stone is a naturalamethystwith more than 35 carats, the Soul Stone isspessartite, exceeding 35 carats, and the Mind Stone is a cut yellowdiamond, that's close to 35 carats.[64]AfterInfinity Warreleased in theaters,Hot Toysunveiled a 1:1 scale Infinity Gauntlet with the Stones capable of lighting up with the use of embedded LED lights.[65]Legoalso released their own Infinity Gauntlet set in 2021 to celebrate the Infinity Saga.[66]\n\nThe Snap and the Blip entered the popular lexicon as a metaphor for the idea of unilaterally bringing into being one's desired goals through one's force of will alone. In a November 30, 2023, article forSFGate, columnist Drew Magary reacted to the conduct of billionaire entrepreneur andTwitterownerElon Musk, who contended that large advertisers who left Twitter after Musk had praised a tweet espousing theGreat Replacementtheory as \"the actual truth\" would be to blame if their exodus bankrupted that company, rather than Musk himself. WhenNew York Timescontributor Andrew Ross Sorkin stated that those advertisers would likely dispute this, Musk replied, \"Tell it to Earth.\" Taking a critical view of this position, Magary, wrote:[67]\n\n\"But Musk, who told Sorkin that he believed data to be more valuable than gold, remains committed to the idea that owning X means owning the chief information exchange for all of this planet's 8 billion citizens. He thinks he canThanos Snapwars and recessions into being merely by posting a recycled Pepe the Frog meme from 2016 on there. There is no reasoning with someone who is so megalomaniacal and so, SO stupid.\"[67]\n\nA 2018 article inExtreme Mechanics Lettersproposed that Thanos would have needed \"a minimum grip strength of over 40,000 tons, which is approximately 750,000 times that of a typical man\", to break the Tesseract depicted in the film, presuming that the object was an \"all-carbon nano-tesseract or hypercube projected into 3D space\".[68]A study published in 2020 focused on the ability to control matter as Thanos does while using the Stones. The researchers found that on amacroscopic level, someone would need a large amount of energy to control matter, similarly to the Stones. However,microscopiclyscientists can mimic Thanos' control of matter at thecolloidallevel. The researchers were able to make billions of colloidal particles with changeable responsiveness, patchiness, shapes, and sizes by manipulating them using triggers, including temperature, pH, and light.[69]",

Lesser beings would face dire consequences:Johann Schmidtwas cursed toVormirto guard theSoul Stoneafter touching an activeTesseract,Jane Fosterbecame ill after being exposed to theAether,Carinaexploded when she touched thePower Stone; however, these effects can be reduced if a group is sharing the power among themselves. It is also possible to place an Infinity Stone (or multiple) inside a container to allow the user to wield the Stone's power without suffering the normal repercussions. Examples include theSpace Stoneinside theTesseract, theMind Stoneinside theScepterand later inVision's forehead, thePower Stoneinside theOrband later theUniversal Weapon, theTime Stoneinside theEye of Agamotto, theReality Stoneas the Aether, and all of the Infinity Stones housed in theInfinity Gauntlet.\n\nWhen Thanos successfully collected all of them, he used their phenomenal powers toannihilatehalf of all living creatures in the universe. He later used the stones' power to reduce them to atoms, as to prevent his work from being undone and to keep himself or anyone else from abusing their power.\n\nFive years later, theAvengerstraveledback in timeto retrieve the stones from alternate timelines in order toresurrectthe victims of the Snap. After theBattle of Earth,Captain Americareturned the stones to their respective timelines.\n\nBefore the universe began, six singularities existed. TheBig Bangthen formed concentrated crystals out of them and sent the six stones hurtling throughout the universe. Each stone represented a different aspect of the universe (Space,Mind,Reality,Power,Time, andSoul).[4]\n\nEson the Searcheruses thePower Stoneto destroy an entire planet\n\nIn the distant past, thePower Stonewas used by theCelestialsas a means of placing judgment upon worlds and their populaces, wiping out entire civilizations by touching its power on the planet's surface. However, the stone was just as dangerous to its handler as it was to the societies against which it was used, as its insufficiently powerful handlers were destroyed by its power.[3]\n\nMalekithattempts to use theAether's power\n\nMalekith, the leader of theDark Elvessought to use theAetherto revert the universe to its prior state of eternal darkness, recementing his kind as the most dominant race in the universe. They were opposed by theAsgardiansunder the command of their king,Bor, who fought a protractedwar, eventually forcing the Dark Elves to retreat to their home world,Svartalfheim, where the finalbattlewas fought. In one last, desperate move, Malekith dropped the Dark Elf air fleet onto the battlefield, wiping out scores of Asgardians and Dark Elves, including his wife and son.\nMalekith took advantage of the ensuing chaos to escape on the remaining ship, with his lieutenantAlgrimand several dozen other warriors, entering a state of hibernation until the time of the nextConvergence, when Malekith intended to make another attempt at total conquest.\n\nBororders that the Aether be hidden away\n\nBelieving the Dark Elves completely defeated, Bor was left to decide what was to be done with the Aether. Knowing it was too powerful to be destroyed, his ordered it buried deep enough that it could never be found again. The order was carried out, and the Aether remained untouched for 5,000 years.[2]\n\nRed Skullcreates weapons with theTesseract\n\nDuringWorld War II,Johann Schmidtbecame fascinated by tales of ancient mythical powers and decided to locate theTesseractto discover its true power. In1942, Schmidt invadedTønsbergand found the Tesseract in a box hidden behind a sculptured mural ofYggdrasil, the world tree. Schmidt took the Tesseract back toHYDRA Headquartersto be experimented on byArnim Zola. Schmidt and Zola were able to harness the Tesseract's power to create and fuel their weapons of war.\n\nTheTesseractteleportingRed SkulltoVormir\n\nInMarch 1945, Schmidt intended to use the Tesseract-poweredValkyrieand itsflying energy bombsto attack theUnited States of America. However, Schmidt wasconfrontedbyCaptain Americaand theHowling Commandoswho aimed to stop him. During the battle, Rogers damaged the machine that was using the Tesseract to power theValkyrie. Angered, Schmidt physically handled the Tesseract, burning his hand. As punishment for abusing the power of an Infinity Stone for selfish gain, the Tesseract opened a portal leading to the far-off planet ofVormirand banished Schmidt to remain there.[4]\n\nTheTesseractis found byHoward Stark\n\nWith Schmidt believed dead, the Tesseract fell while burning through the floors of theValkyrie, causing it to plunge into the sea below. Sometime later, it was recovered byHoward Stark, CEO ofStark Industriesand a member of theStrategic Scientific Reserve, who was attempting to locate his friend Captain America. Stark had the Tesseract locked away with the SSR where it was kept and studied for the next seventy years.[7]\n\nTheSpace Stoneused as an energy core\n\nUnderstanding that theKreebrought only misery to theSkrullsduring theKree-Skrull War, the Kree scientist,Mar-Vell, intended to help a group of Skrull refugees led byTalos, to find a new home away from Kree oppression. Mar-Vell impersonated as a human named Dr. Wendy Lawson and worked for theUnited States Air ForceonProject P.E.G.A.S.U.S.in order to harness the power of theTesseractto develop aLight-Speed Engine. The pilotsCarol DanversandMaria Rambeauwere unknowingly testing the engine in test flights. At the time the Tesseract was stored onMar-Vell's Laboratory, located inEarth's orbit.\n\nCarol Danversis exposed to theSpace Stone\n\nOne day, Mar-Vell and Danvers on a test flight of the Light-Speed Engine were attacked byStarforceand shot-down. The two crashed and Mar-Vell revealed herself to Danvers as a Kree and her motives with the engine and urged her to not let the Kree acquire it. Mar-Vell was shot and killed by Starforce commander,Yon-Rogg, who was then about to kill Danvers as well, but she shot the engine and destroyed it, creating an energy explosion. Danvers absorbed the Tesseract's energy during the explosion and gained superhuman abilities. Yon-Rogg then took her as Kree prisoner toHala, erasing her memories in the process and giving her a blood transfusion.\n\nTheTesseractbeing vomited up byGoose\n\nAfter six years, when Danvers returned to Earth, she joined forces withNick FuryfromS.H.I.E.L.D.and learned the truth about the Kree-Skrull War from Talos after she regained some of her memories. Wanting to assist Talos' people, Danvers and Fury flew to Mar-Vell's laboratory to retrieve the Tesseract. When they found it and the Skrulls, the Starforce arrived and tried to take the Tesseract. Fury fled to Earth with the Skrulls and the Tesseract, which had been swallowed by theFlerken,Goose. Following Danvers' victory over the Kree, she left Earth with the Skrulls, letting Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. keep the Tesseract, which Goose vomited up on Fury's desk.[8]∆\n\nTheTesseracttransportsLokitoEarth\n\nIn2012, after his defeat at the hands ofThor,Lokicame into contact with the alien race known as theChitauri, and their master,Thanos, who had already been seeking theTesseract. Loki promised to retrieve it fromEarthand give it to Thanos in exchange for his army. Through manipulation of the Tesseract's energy, Thanos teleported Loki to the Tesseract's location at theJoint Dark Energy Mission Facility.\n\nHawkeyeis controlled by theMind Stone\n\nThanos also provided Loki with aSceptercontaining theMind Stone. Once Loki arrived on Earth, he found a team ofS.H.I.E.L.D.agents who had been experimenting with the Tesseract's power. Loki used the power of the Scepter todefeatthem all, before puttingClint Barton,Erik Selvig, and several other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents under his complete control, ordering them to killNick Furyand steal the Tesseract for him. Selvig continued to experiment on the Tesseract in order to learn how to open a large sustainable portal.\n\nBruce Bannerunwittingly holds theScepter\n\nWhen Loki was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., the Scepter fell into their hands and was experimented on byTony StarkandBruce Banner. However, the Mind Stone's power proved more subtle and began to infect theAvengerspersonally, making them more doubtful and causing a large argument between them that only ended when Banner realized that he had been unwittingly made to pick up the Scepter. During theAttack on the Helicarrier, Loki regained the Scepter, which he used to murderPhil Coulsonbefore escaping.\n\nTheTesseractopens a portal between worlds\n\nSelvig used the Tesseract andStark Towerto create a portal aboveNew York Citywhich allowed Loki's army to pour through andattack, beginning theChitauri Invasion. With hordes ofChitauriandLeviathanscharging through the portal, only theAvengersstood in their way. Loki tried and failed to controlIron Manwith the Scepter. Eventually,Black Widowwas able to close the portal using the Scepter while Iron Man destroyed theChitauri Command Centerwith anAtomic Bombbefore Loki was captured by the team.\n\nTheTesseractis handed over toAsgard\n\nWhile Loki was taken back toAsgardwithThorto await punishment by their fatherOdin, theTesseractwas handed over to Thor to be kept away from theWorld Security Council. Thor and Loki used the cube to teleport themselves back to Asgard[1]before Thor handed it over toHeimdallwho used its power to rebuild theBifrost Bridge,[9]which had been destroyed during theDuel at the Rainbow Bridge,[10]finally allowing Thor and the other Asgardians to be transported across theNine Realmswith ease once again.[2]\n\nMalekithfinally regains theAether\n\nAs theConvergencebegan across theNine Realms,Jane Fosteraccidentally discovered and became infected with theAether, alerting theDark Elvesto its presence.MalekithwagedwaragainstAsgard, who were protecting Foster, to regain the Aether. Eventually Foster came toSvartalfheimwhere Malekith reclaimed the Aether and absorbed it.\n\nMalekithunleashes theAether's power\n\nMalekith took the Aether toEarthwhere he attempted to use its power to convert the entire universe into eternal darkness. Thor also returned to Earth where heconfrontedthe leader of the Dark Elves. Malekith used the Aether to battle Thor across worlds during the Convergence until eventually, they became separated and Malekith unleashed the Aether's power. Thor andErik Selvigwere able to destroy Malekith before he could complete his plans.\n\nTheAetheris given to theCollector\n\nThe Aether was soon regained byAsgardwho decided that it was too dangerous to keep two Infinity Stones so close together, so they kept theTesseractwhere it was and decided to relocate the Aether. Eventually,SifandVolstaggdecided to hand the Aether over toTaneleer Tivan, who vowed to keep it safe within theCollector's Museum. However, once the Asgardians left, Tivan revealed his intent to locate the other five stones for his collection.[2]\n\nBaronWolfgang von Struckerwith theScepter\n\nWhile theTesseractwas taken toAsgard, theScepterremained on Earth where it fell into the hands ofHYDRA's leaderWolfgang von Strucker. In HYDRA's hands, Strucker andListbegan experimenting with giving normal humans gifts via the Scepter's power, and, in the process, killing everyone except forPietroandWanda Maximoff, who were granted incredible powers to be used for HYDRA's benefit in theirwarwithS.H.I.E.L.D.[11]\n\nStar-Lorddiscovering theOrb\n\nTheOrbwas hidden away insideMorag's deepTemple Vaultwhere it was eventually located byYondu Udonta'sRavagers. Before Udonta could claim it, however,Star-Lordfound it and took it for himself, only to be almost immediately confronted byKorathwho had been ordered to find it byRonan the Accuser. During theirensuing confrontation, Star-Lord escaped with the Orb, despite being chased down by Korath's army ofSakaaransand becoming the target ofGamora, who had been sent byThanosand Ronan to reclaim the Orb. TheNova Corpscaptured Star-Lord for his crimes and also took the Orb.\n\nTheCollectorfinally opens theOrb\n\nStar-Lord and Gamora made a deal, along withRocket,GrootandDrax the Destroyerto join forces toescapetheKylnand sell the Orb to theCollector. The plan worked out and eventually, the group made it toKnowherewhere they were greeted byCarinaand the Collector, who told them the full story of the Infinity Stones. Just before the Collector could buy the Orb, Carina, who was tired of the torment her master put her through, touched the stone inside, causing a massive explosion that destroyed theCollector's Museumand forced them to escape.\n\nRonan the Accusertakes theOrb's power\n\nAs a result, the Orb was located byRonan the Accuser, whose forces ofSakaaransled byNebulamanaged tooverpowerGamoraand claim the Orb for themselves. Having learned that the Orb contained the Power Stone, however, Ronan chose not to hand it over toThanosas he had agreed. Instead, he took its power for himself, planning to use it to destroyXandarbefore attacking Thanos himself, while gaining the support of bothNebulaandKorathin his plans.\n\nTheGuardians of the Galaxyunleash the energy of thePower Stone\n\nAlthoughRonan the Accuserattempted to destroyXandarwith thePower Stone's incredible power, he was confronted by theGuardians of the Galaxywho were supported by theRavagersand theNova Corps. During theBattle of Xandar, Ronan's ship theDark Asterwas destroyed and he himself was killed when Star-Lord took the Power Stone's power. Gamora sealed the Stone back into the Orb and Star-Lord handed it over to the Nova Corps to be locked away for safety.[3]\n\nTony Starkfinds and takes theScepter\n\nHaving been held byWolfgang von Strucker, theScepterwas eventuallyfoundby theAvengersand taken into the custody ofTony Stark, who decided to use it in his experiments to bring life toUltron, who he planned to use to bring about a peaceful world with the help ofBruce Banner. However, the Mind Stone gave Ultron too much wisdom and gave him a vicious and bloodthirsty viewpoint of humanity itself, driving him to the point that he sought to destroy it completely.\n\nTheMind Stonegives birth to theVision\n\nDuring hiswarwith the Avengers, Ultron stole the Scepter and used it, while combining the knowledge and resources ofHelen Choand thevibraniumhe had taken fromUlysses Klaue, to create a new and powerful body known as theVision. The being was taken from him when the Avengers stole theRegeneration Cradleduring theBattle of Seoul, leading to Stark, Banner, andThorgranting the being life with the Mind Stone embedded in its skull.\n\nVisiondestroying the army ofUltron Sentries\n\nThe Vision viewed Ultron as a danger toEarthand decided to join the Avengers in fighting him. During theBattle of Sokovia, the Vision used the power of theMind Stoneagainst the overwhelming army ofUltron Sentriesand combined its power withIron Manand Thor's power to overpower and defeat Ultron, who could not match Vision's power. With the war won, Vision decided to join the Avengers and use his remarkable power to aid in the protection of Earth.[12]\n\nThoris given a vision of the Infinity Stones\n\nThorwent to theWater of Sightto see again the disturbing vision thatWanda Maximoffhad caused him to have during theBattle at the Salvage Yard. Garnering better details, Thor saw theScepterrelieved of its stone, theAether, theOrb, and theTesseractall lined up into a row. Thor then went toAvengers Towerand helped to bringVisionto life because he possessed the Mind Stone; Thor understood its relationship to the other Stones and how Vision could help in the final defeat ofUltron. Later, Thor related his knowledge that four of the Infinity Stones had been located.[12]\n\nVisionexpresses his fears toWanda Maximoff\n\nAs they were talking at theAvengers Compound,Visionexplained toWanda Maximoffthat although he knew where theMind Stonehad come from, he did not know its true nature. He said to her that the more he understood it, the less it controlled him and someday he may control it. Later, during theRescue of Wanda Maximoff, Maximoff used her powers to control the Mind Stone and push Vision many meters beneath the facility.\n\nVisionaccidentally shootsWar Machine\n\nThe next day, at the end of theBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport,War Machineasked Vision to disableFalcon's wings with the Stone. However, the beam Vision fired accidentally hit War Machine'sArc Reactor, causing him to crash onto the ground. At the hospital whereJames Rhodeswas treated,Tony Starkapproached Vision and asked him how it had happened. Vision answered that he had been distracted, which he did not know was possible.[13]\n\nDoctor Strangeuses theEye of Agamotto\n\nHaving been stored withinKamar-Tajfor safeguarding, theEye of Agamottowas eventually discovered byDoctor Strangeduring his studies. Taking the Eye, Strange experimented with its power by creating a time loop in which he regrew an apple several times until he was discovered byWong, who warned him to stop due to the risks of using such a powerful item. Strange kept the Eye with him during hisbattlesagainstKaeciliusand theZealots, not yet using its power.\n\nDoctor Strangeuses theEye of Agamottoto defeatDormammu\n\nWhen Strange andKarl Mordotraveled toHong KongtoconfrontKaecilius, they discovered that the Sanctum located there had already been destroyed and that Kaecilius and his Zealots were successful in their plan to bringDormammuand theDark DimensiontoEarth. Strange then used the Eye's power to rebuild the Sanctum by reversing time. However, Kaecilius stopped him, almost allowing Dormammu to come to Earth, so Strangewent into the Dark Dimensionand used the Eye to trap Dormammu in a time loop.\n\nDoctor Strangereturns theEye of Agamotto\n\nEach time Doctor Strange was killed by Dormammu, time reversed until just before their confrontation, where Strange kept Dormammu prisoner, albeit at the cost of his suffering. Strange told Dormammu to end his assault and take his zealots with him in exchange for Strange breaking the loop. With the war over, Strange left the Eye in Kamar-Taj with Wong having confidence Strange could wield the Eye without abusing its power once he has mastered its powers. Until then, he cannot wear it in public.[14]Strange would soon bear the title of Master of the Mystic Arts and did eventually earn the right to wear the Eye, as was seen during his meeting withThor.[15]\n\nLokidecides to steal theTesseract\n\nWhenHelawas inOdin's Vault, she passed by theTesseractand noted that it \"[wasn't] bad,\" making it the only relic she was actually even remotely impressed by. Later, asLokiwas about to summon upSurturto causeRagnarök, he passed by the Tesseract as well and took it so he could warp himself to theStatesmanship withThorand the rest of theAsgardiansbeforeAsgardwas obliterated.[15]\n\nThanosbrandishes thePower Stone\n\nThe Mad Titan,Thanos, brandished agauntletcreated to harness the power of the Infinity Stones, having decided to personally hunt for the Stones after having lost many of his resources in his failed alliances. Along with his children, theBlack Order, he traveled toXandar, decimating the Nova Corps and Empire to acquire thePower Stonewhile alsomassacringhalf of Xandar's population as part of his goal to wipe out half of the universe.\n\nThanosacquires theSpace Stone\n\nA week later, heattackedtheAsgardianship, theStatesman, killing half the population aboard (which was already dwindling in numbers due toHela) and beating bothThorandHulkalmost to death. To stop the assault,Lokigave him theTesseract, which Thanos shattered to reveal theSpace Stoneinside. Thanos then used the Space Stone to stop an attempted assassination from Loki, whom he killed and left aboard the explodingStatesmanto continue his mission.\n\nThanosusing theReality Stone\n\nUpon arriving atKnowhere, Thanos confronted theCollectorfor theReality Stoneand was able to get it from him. Thanos used the Reality Stone to deceive theGuardians of the Galaxyand trick and capture his daughter,Gamora. Upon seeing her sister,Nebula, being tortured by their father,Gamorarevealed the hidden location of theSoul Stone.\n\nThanosobtains theSoul Stone\n\nTogether, Thanos and Gamora traveled toVormirand confrontedRed Skullwho had been teleported to the planet over 70 years ago after his brief contact with the Tesseract. Red Skull revealed the Soul Stone could only appear after one sacrificed the thing they loved most, claiming it was a trading of souls. A heartbroken Thanos tearfully threw his daughter over the cliff and she fell to her death. After a blinding light, Thanos awoke with the stone in his hand, which he added to the gauntlet.\n\nDoctor Strangeprotects theTime Stone\n\nMeanwhile,Doctor Strangehad continued to defend the Time Stone in theEye of Agamottoand placed a spell on the necklace to protect it. After a conflict withCull ObsidianandEbony Maw, Doctor Strange was captured and taken aboard their ship where he was tortured by Maw until he was rescued byIron ManandSpider-Man. The trio then traveled to Thanos' homeworld,Titan, and met with theGuardians of the Galaxy.\n\nDoctor Strangehanding over theTime Stone\n\nAfter alengthy battle with Thanos, in which the power of the Infinity Stones proved crucial for Thanos' victory, the group was defeated and Strange was forced to relinquish the Time Stone to Thanos in order to saveIron Man's life. Thanos then used the gauntlet to teleport toWakandawhere, after he was severely injured byCorvus GlaiveandProxima Midnight,Visionand the Mind Stone were located.\n\nThanosrips theMind Stoneout ofVision\n\nAt theBattle of Wakanda, Thanos used the Infinity Stones' powers to effortlessly overpower every single hero that opposed him.Wanda Maximoffwas forced to destroy theMind StoneandVisionas she held back Thanos. After briefly attempting to comfort Scarlet Witch for her grief, Thanos used the Time Stone to restore Vision by reversing the explosion.\n\nThanosfinally collects all of the Infinity Stones\n\nAfter ripping the Stone from his head, Vision died once again and Thanos finally completed the Infinity Gauntlet. Thor, with his new weaponStormbreaker, attacked Thanos with one powerful hurl of the enormous battle axe, inflicting a near-fatal injury on the Titan. Not to be deterred, however, Thanos mocked Thor before completing his goal andsnapping his fingers. Immediately after, Thanos used the damaged gauntlet to simultaneously heal himself from the battle wound and teleport to safety, having succeeded in his mission.\n\nThanossuccessfully executes theSnap\n\nA few moments later, half the population of the universe began to disintegrate.Bucky Barnes,T'Challa,Groot,Wanda Maximoff,Sam Wilson,Mantis,Drax,Peter Quill,Stephen Strange,Peter Parker,Shuri,Maria Hill,Nick Fury,Sif,Betty Ross,Erik Selvig,Jane Foster,Hank Pym,Janet van Dyne,Hope van Dyne,Laura Barton,Cooper Barton,Lila Barton,Nathaniel Barton,Monica Rambeau, andYelena Belovawere among the victims.[4][16][17][18]Thanos reappeared on a quiet forested planet. His arm was still scarred from the snap, but all of his other wounds had fully healed and he satisfactorily gazed at the sunrise with a smile on his face.[4]\n\nThree weeks later,Thanosused the power of the Stones to destroy them, reducing them down to atoms.[19]\n\nBy2023, the Infinity Stones had become public knowledge. Many people who had no prior knowledge of the Stones, such asJimmy WooandDarcy Lewis, knew about them.[17]Additionally,Kamala Khan, who also had no prior knowledge of the Stones, learned about them throughScott Lang's podcast interviews.[5]\n\nBy2024, the Infinity Stones had become part ofMidtown School of Science and Technology's history classes. Additionally, hand-drawn posters of the Stones were hung up within the school.[20]\n\nBy2025, the bookI Was There..., which was written by aS.H.I.E.L.D.agent, was released and it included a first-hand account ofTony Stark's usage of the Infinity Stones during theBattle of Earth.[5][21]\n\nTheAvengerslocate the Infinity Stones\n\nIn2023, theAvengersinitiated theirTime Heist, in which they wouldtime travelthrough theMultiversein order to acquire Infinity Stones from alternate pasts. The team conveneed at thefacilityand brainstormed the locations of the Infinity Stones in the past in order to use them to bring everyone back.Rocketshared thatPeter Quillhad found thePower StoneonMorag.Nebulaprovided thatThanoshad gone toVormirwithGamorato acquire theSoul Stone.Thorshared his story when he encountered theReality Stone. While talking about whereDoctor Strangelived,Black Widowrealized that theTime,MindandSpace Stoneswere all inNew Yorkat a very specific point. The Avengers suited up and began their mission in three teams.\n\nLokiescapes with theTesseract\n\nCaptain America,Iron Man,Ant-Man, andHulkappeared at theBattle of New Yorkand split up. Iron Man, Captain America and Ant-Man grabbed theScepter, holding the Mind Stone. But ultimately lost the Space Stone asLokigrabbed theTesseractand teleported away.\n\nAncient OneandBruce Bannerdiscuss the Infinity Stones\n\nHulk approached theAncient One, who explained he was five years too early to consult withStephen Strange. The two had a lengthy discussion where the Ancient One said taking an Infinity Stone from the past would doom that branched reality. Swearing to return the stone to the moment they took it from, Hulk explained that Strange had handed over the Time Stone to Thanos, much to the Ancient One's astonishment. Carefully removing the Time Stone from theEye of Agamotto, she stated he must have had his reason in doing so.\n\nRocketextracts theReality Stone\n\nAppearing onAsgardin the year2013, Rocket and Thor made their way toJane Foster, who was infected with the Aether. Thor found it too difficult to continue forward and ran away. Rocket acquired the Reality Stone, while Thor had an emotional talk with his mother,Frigga, who realized that he was from the future. The two had an emotional goodbye before Thor calledMjølnirto himself and traveled back to the present.\n\nNebulamanages to steal thePower Stone\n\nTraveling toMoragin the year2014, Nebula andWar Machine, waited for Peter Quill to arrive, whileHawkeyeand Black Widow flew to Vormir. After knocking Quill out, Nebula retrieved theOrband handed it to Rhodey who traveled back to2023. Nebula, however, unwillingly began interfacing withher 2014 self.Thanosbecame aware of their plan and captured the original timeline version of Nebula and had the two trade places.\n\nHawkeyereceives theSoul Stone\n\nArriving on Vormir,Red Skullappeared to Hawkeye and Black Widow, saying that only one of them could leave with the stone, while the other one had to sacrifice themselves for it. After engaging in a brief combat, due to their disagreement over who should be the sacrifice, Hawkeye jumped off the cliff but was tackled by Black Widow. The two clung to the cliff before a Black Widow released herself from Hawkeye's grip, falling to her death. With the sacrifice fulfilled, Hawkeye awoke with the Soul Stone in his hand.\n\nTony Starksteals theTesseractfrom1970\n\nTracking the Tesseract toApril 7, 1970, Iron Man and Captain America traveled toCamp Lehighand acquired the Space Stone and morePym Particles. Iron Man had a lengthy conversation with his father, and finally received a proper goodbye, even thoughHowardwas unaware of who he was. The two traveled back to 2023 and rejoined the other Avengers. Hawkeye revealed that Black Widow had sacrificed herself for the Soul Stone, and the Avengers mourned her, then got to work creating theNano Gauntlet.[19]\n\nTheNano Gauntletis created\n\nUpon creating theNano Gauntlet, Rocket, Iron Man and Hulk inserted the six Infinity Stones into the weapon. A small debate broke out on who should wield the gauntlet. Meanwhile, analternate Nebula, who had infiltrated the Avengers, created a time gateway to analternate 2014and theSanctuary IIemerged in 2023 and destroyed the Quantum Tunnel.\n\nHulkwielding theNano Gauntlet\n\nEventually, Hulk put on the gauntlet, which caused him incredible pain. Slowly raising his arm, Hulk snapped his fingers andresurrectedall living creatures whomThanoshad turned to dustfive years ago. Immediately, birds flew onto trees outside the Avengers Compound pleasing Ant-Man, and Hawkeye received a phone call from his now resurrectedwife. Before the Avengers could celebrate, theSanctuary IIrained down missiles on the Avengers Compound.[19]\n\nHawkeyeprotecting the Infinity Stones\n\nSeparated by the attack,Hawkeyefound himself in the access tunnels, along with theNano Gauntlet. After discovering a horde ofOutriders, Hawkeye protected the Gauntlet as he ran from the aliens. Once he was safe from them, analternate Nebulatricked Hawkeye to give her the Gauntlet. However, after she was killed by the originalNebula, Hawkeye picked up the Gauntlet and continued to protect the Infinity Stones.\n\nCaptain Marveltries to return the Infinity Stones\n\nWhen Hawkeye joined thebattleoutside,Captain Americatold him to get the Infinity Stones as far away from analternate Thanosas possible, butHulktold them that they needed to return the stones to their time. Passing the gauntlet fromBlack PanthertoSpider-Man, Ant-Man and theWaspwent toLuis' Vanwhich had a Quantum Tunnel that could return the Infinity Stones to their correct times.Captain Marveltook the gauntlet from Spider-Man and made her way toward the tunnel. Thanos, however, threw hisswordat the tunnel, destroying it.\n\nIron Manwields the Infinity Stones\n\nCaptain Marvel, Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man tried to prevent Thanos from grabbing the gauntlet but failed. Captain Marvel was unfazed by Thanos' attacks and stopped him from snapping his fingers again. Removing the Power Stone, Thanos blasted Captain Marvel away and once again prepared to decimate the universe only to once again be stopped, this time by Iron Man. Thanos threw Iron Man aside and snapped his fingers, stating that he was inevitable. When nothing happened, however, Thanos looked to Iron Man who had created his own gauntlet with nanotech and brandished the stones himself. Stark then snapped his fingers, resulting in Thanos and his entire army disintegrating.\n\nThe Infinity Stones before being returned to their original timelines\n\nFollowing Iron Man's funeral, Captain America, with Hulk's help, went back in time and returned the stones to their respective timelines.[19]\n\nInfinity Stones that were confiscated by theTVA\n\nWhenLokifrom analternate 2012was taken into custody by theTime Variance Authorityand escaped their confinement, he forced a TVA clerk namedCaseyto return theTesseractto him. However, when he was given the Tesseract, Loki saw that it was in a drawer that contained several other Infinity Stones from various alternate timelines. Casey then told Loki that some employees used Infinity Stones as paperweights since they were powerless inside theTime Variance Authority Office.[22]\n\nIn analternate universe, afterStrange Supremeresurrected his late girlfriendChristine Palmer, his universe began to collapse. He then sawWatcher, whom he had sensed earlier, and he begged the Watcher to help him. The Watcher refused, telling Strange that he could not interfere. The universe eventually collapsed, destroying most life in it, except for Strange, as well as most of the Infinity Stones, except for the Time Stone.[23]\n\nThezombifiedThanoswith the Infinity Stones\n\nIn analternate 2018, five of the Infinity Stones had been acquired byThanoson his quest to acquire all six Stones. After Thanos travelled to Earth to acquire theMind Stone, he became infected with aquantum virusand turned into azombie. Despite this, he was able to retain the Stones that he had acquired.[24]\n\nThe Infinity Stones inUltron's possession\n\nIn analternate universe,Thanoshad acquired five Infinity Stones and teleported toEarthin order to acquire the sixth. However, he was met byUltronwho was fascinated by the Stones and killed Thanos in order to claim them. Ultron then used theMind Stonein his forehead to destroy part of theInfinity Gauntletin order to remove the five Stones that Thanos had acquired from the Gauntlet and absorbed the Stones into his armor. After being in possession of all six, Ultron recognized the existence of other planets in the universe. He used theReality Stoneto reanimate hisarmyand led them into space. There, Ultron used the combined power of all six Stones to destroyAsgard,Sovereign,Sakaar,Ego, andXandaras well as the rest of the planets in the universe. After the universe was silent, Ultron became aware ofWatcher's presence inside theObservational Plane, as well as the existence of theMultiversewhich caused Ultron to hunt down the Watcher. Ultron used the Stones' power to break into the Plane and attacked the Watcher by blasting him with thePower Stone. However, the Watcher was able to fight back against Ultron and they battled throughout multiple universes. After the Watcher surrendered and fled, Ultron returned to the Nexus and with the Stones' power, vowed to destroy the Multiverse.[25]\n\nTheGuardians of the Multiverselearn about the Infinity Stones\n\nAfter locating theGuardians of the Multiverse, Ultron arrived at their location in an uninhabited universe and prepared to kill them using the Stones. He used the Stones' power to cause the ground they were standing on to fall hoping that they would be crushed. During the brief scuffle,Star-Lordmanaged to grab theSoul Stoneoff of Ultron's armor. When Ultron was confronted by azombifiedWanda Maximoff, he used the Stones' power to obliterate the universe that they were in. T'Challa proceeded to transport the Soul Stone to Ultron's home universe.\n\nThe Infinity Stones inKillmonger's possession\n\nHowever, when they arrived,Natasha Romanofffound them and snatched the Stone from T'Challa. Ultron arrived and tried to get the Stone back, but the Guardians fought him to keep him away from it. Eventually,Gamoragrabbed the Stone, but Ultron used theTime Stoneto freeze time to grab the Stone.Strange Supremeused his Time Stone to reverse Ultron's actions and Gamora managed to place theInfinity Crusheron him with the intention of destroying the Stones. However, the Crusher didn't work as the Stones were from Ultron's universe and the Crusher only worked on the Stones from Gamora's universe. After Romanoff shotArnim Zola's analog consciousness into Ultron via an arrow, Ultron was killed.Erik Killmongerseized the opportunity and stole the Stones in order to kill the Guardians, but he was stopped by Zola, leading to a tug-of-war between the two for sole possession of the Stones. Strange then realized that their mission was to separate the Stones from Ultron's body and trapped Zola, Killmonger, and the separated Stones in a pocket dimension with The Watcher's help.[26]\n\nAfter being freed during theBattle at the Sanctum Infinitum, Killmonger gained control of the Infinity Stones and used them to killThanos. However, he was quickly separated from them byKahhori.[27]\n\nThe Infinity Stones remain inThanos'Infinity Gauntletafter his defeat and death\n\nIn analternate 2018, four of the Infinity Stones had been acquired byThanoson hisquestto acquire all six Stones. When Thanos travelled toTitan, he was promptly confronted by theIlluminati. They killed him and left the Stones in theInfinity Gauntleton his corpse.[28]\n\nTheForbidden Lake\n\nIn analternate universe,SurterinvadedAsgard, triggingRagnarök.Odinattempted to stop him using theTesseract, but Surtur succeding indestroying Asgard. The Tesseract survived Asgard's destruction and crash landed onEarthin the territory of theHaudenosaunee Confederacy. The Tesseract broke upon impact and its energy was released into theForbidden Lake. The lake was soon discovered by nearby tribes, but when anyone tried to swim in the lake they disappeared, causing conflict to break out. The conflict left the lake's reputation permanently stained, with no one being allowed to swim in its waters.\n\nWhen Kahorri's village was attacked by theConquistadores, she came across the Forbidden Lake. She fell into the lake and was transported to theSky World. Kahhori spent time in the Sky World and learned to gain control over her newfound abilities before she decided to return to her village to stop the Conquistadores. She managed to convince the Sky World inhabitants to come with her and they helped hersaveher people from the Spanish Empire.[29]\n\nTo be added[30]\n\nTo be added[27]\n\nIn an alternate universe,Ultrongained all of the Infinity Stones and used them to destroy his entire universe. However, having never become aware of theWatcher's presence, Ultron simply remained in his destroyed universe.[31]\n\nTheMind Stone,Power Stone,Reality Stone, andSpace Stone\n\nAs the Infinity Stones are the representation of all the necessary aspects of existence, they have absolute control over the fabric of reality they represent and from it, they derive extremely powerful capabilities to be wielded and are the most powerful artifacts in the known universe. Their power keeps the stability of the universe, meaning if they were removed from their reality, said reality would suffer catastrophic consequences in time.Thordescribes the Infinity Stones as the greatest power in the universe, and \"unparalleled\" in their destructive capabilities. The power of theTime Stonewas able to render even an phenomenally powerful cosmic being ofDormammu's caliber powerless to do anything to break it. TheReality Stone's power can affect the whole universe, withMalekithintending to use its capabilities to cover the whole universe in darkness. TheSpace Stonewas thought to be capable of channeling energy sufficient to destroy a planet with thePower Stonebeing able to destroy worlds and dimensions simply via its energy making contact with their surface. EvenAsgarddeems it unwise to house two stones in one place, despite the fact that theirvaultis extremely well guarded.\n\nAugmented by the Power Stone, theDark Asterwas able to easily breach the considerable defenses that surroundedXandarwithIrani Raeldeclaring a state of emergency once she learned thatRonanwielded it. One of the greatest feats of power ever to be seen from the use of the Infinity Stones was their power to turn living beings into dust. Such power alone was the true motivation for Thanos to seek out the Infinity Stones in the first place. When all six Stones are brought together and properly channeled, they make their wielder virtually omnipotent, being able to affect the universe in almost any way they choose, whichThanosdemonstrated when he killed half of all life in the universe via asimple finger snap. Likewise, the Infinity Stones were the only way toresurrectall those who were decimated by Thanos. The combined power of all the Infinity Stones could not resurrectNatasha Romanoff, however, who had sacrificed herself so that theAvengerscould have the Soul Stone. In addition, the combined power of all the Infinity Stones could even destroy the Universe and recreate it to the wielder's image. With the power of all six Infinity Stones, analternate Ultronbecame an extraordinarily powerful cosmic being and was capable of effortlessly decimating universes. He surpassed even the might ofWatcher.\n\nTheSoul Stonewas located inVormirand had held a special place within the ranks of the Infinity Stones. According toWong's ancient texts, the Soul Stone could be the most dangerous Infinity Stone. In order to wield the Soul Stone, the Soul Stone demanded that those who seek to wield it must first sacrifice someone they loved, so as to ensure that whoever seeks the Soul Stone does indeed understand its power. The Soul Stone can manipulate the spiritual essence of living or deceased beings, making it one of the most dangerous Infinity Stones. The Soul Stone even has a pocket dimension within it calledSoulworld. Soulworld consists entirely of shallow water underneath a dim orange sky, where the souls of the dead can be communicated with.\n\nHowever, due to their sheer power, only a single being of exceptional power, or collections of lesser beings who are unified and focused in their intent, is able to wield the stones. As a result, the Stones were often placed in mediums that would allow for a limited, but more stable, access to their power such as theEye of Agamottoor theScepter. However, the Soul Stone can be held by normal humans without any additional protection, as Hawkeye held the newly-acquired Stone with only a glove as protection. Metals appear to serve as useful inhibitors for the Stones.Ultron, then formed out of a titanium alloy, was able to hold the Mind Stone in his bare hands and Gamora was instantly able to contain the Power Stone, which had been radiating massively destructive energies, with a simple, mass-produced, metallic container. The power of all six Stones can be harnessed collectively, but prior to Thanos completing theInfinity Gauntlet, this had never been accomplished, all who attempted being overwhelmed by the powers of the individual Stones. However, even the Gauntlet itself was left heavily burnt from channeling and focusing the power of all six Stones, being seemingly rendered useless after it had done this a second time.Ultroncreated theInfinity Armorto house and wield the power of the Infinity Stones without risk of harm, asKillmongerand laterCaptain Carterwore the armor and used the power of the Stones without any harm to themselves.\n\nThe Stones, due to their immense power, are nigh-indestructible with KingBorviewing even the full might of Asgard as insufficient to destroy the Aether with the same stone later being unharmed by Thor unleashing his lightning on it. The only known way to destroy an Infinity Stone is via something that possesses the same unique energy signature as the Stones themselves. In theInfinity War, Vision correctly theorized and that ifWanda Maximoffwere to focus all of her energy back into theMind Stone, the stone's molecular integrity would fail and it would be destroyed. Though she was able to do so, it still took considerable time and effort. The Stone's destruction unleashed all the energies contained within, though the resulting wave was harmless. Her powers likewise allowed her to communicate with, and to a limited extent, control the Stone, having it increase Vision's density against his will. Three weeks after theSnap, Thanos used the Infinity Stones to reduce them to atoms, although they retain their presence in the universe. In addition, Killmonger was able to use the Stones in the Infinity Armor to disintegrateThanosfrom analternate universe, who was equipped with a complete Infinity Gauntlet, also disintegrating the Stones he had in the process. The only known way to recreate a destroyed Infinity Stone is to use the Time Stone to rewind time to before its destruction.Wanda Maximoffwas also able to recreate theMind Stoneinside arecreated Vision's head via herChaos magic. Following theDestruction of Asgardhowever, Thor believed that the fully empoweredSurturhad destroyed theTesseract, suggesting that a sufficiently powerful being could destroy a Stone.Gamoraalso used theInfinity Crusherto destroy the Infinity Stones from heruniverse, though the Crusher didn't work on Stones from alternate universes.\n\nUsing the combined power of all the Infinity Stones simultaneously through the Infinity Gauntlet puts incredibly high amounts of strain on the wearer of the Gauntlet, even risking death. Should the user survive channeling the Stones' energy, they risk burning the side of their body the Stones were on. Thanos barely survived a second snapping, which he used to destroy the stones, being left severely injured and weakened, so much so that he was unable to defend himself against the Avengers when he was ambushed. Hulk was likewise able to survive a snap due to the energy released by the Infinity Stones being mostlygamma radiation, but this came at the cost of his right arm being severely injured. Hulk theorized that not even Thor, an exceptionally powerful Asgardian, would be able to survive a snap, though it should be noted that Thor was not in good physical condition at the time. The Infinity Armor, however, can seemingly be used by any being to channel the Stones' power without any risk of harm to the wearer.\n\nThe energy derived from the Stones has shown the ability to grant superhuman powers. When exposed to the Space Stone derived energies of theLight-Speed Engine,Carol Danverswas gifted with powers based on those of the Space Stone, particularly her enhanced speed and energy channeling.Kahhorilikewise was exposed to the power of the Space Stone, which granted her abilities such as energy projection and portal creation. Likewise, the energy of the Mind Stone allowed Wanda Maximoff to develop telekinetic and telepathic abilities and also granted her brother Pietro the power of superhuman speed. These powers persisted even after the Stones had been destroyed. Similarly, Vision and Ultron's Synthezoid bodies were further augmented by the energy of the Mind Stone, granting them abilities such as intangibility, flight, and the power to generate an energy beam from the Stone, which was strong enough to bisect Thanos. When Vision was rebuilt and reactivated asWhite Vision, he still retained these powers, despite no longer having the stone embedded in his forehead. The Stones can also enhance already-existing powers; the Mind Stone increased Wanda's dormant magical abilities, turning her into the Scarlet Witch and granting her Chaos Magic, tough these powers are more similar to the Reality Stone in both appearance and function.\n\nDespite their immense power, Infinity Stones, like all magical objects, are rendered powerless and practically useless when they are in theTime Variance Authority Office.\n\nEach universes' Infinity Stones are unique. The Infinity Crusher from Gamora's universe was designed to destroy her universes' stones and was unable to destroy the Stones from an alternate universe.\n\nIn chronological order:",

    "title": "A Complete Guide to MCU's 6 Infinity Stones—And Who Has Them | TIME",
    "content": "Warning:This post contains spoilers for all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.\n\nCaptain Marvelchases after the Tesseract, the Guardians of the Galaxysteal an orb, Thortries to capture Aether. These magical objects may seem like MacGuffins, or simply plot devices that are meant to keep the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving forward. But in fact, these objects are Infinity Stones: a group of gems that grant their owner great power.\n\nThanos, an evil, purple alien, used that power to destroy half the universe inAvengers: Infinity War. Now, in theInfinity Warsequel,Avengers:Endgame, it’s up to Marvel’s heroes to reverse that damage, possibly by traveling through time and acquiring and destroying all the Infinity Stones themselves before Thanos can get his hands on them.\n\nThe complexMarvel Cinematic Universe timelinemakes it easy to forget the Infinity Stone names, let alone their powers and where you might have seen them before. After all, there are 21 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And most of the Infinity Stones have multiple names.\n\nBut we’ve got you covered. Here are answers to all of your questions about the Infinity Stones, and what role they’ll play inupcoming Marvel movieslikeAvengers: Endgame.\n\nInfinity Stones are really powerful gems that, when united, can be used to destroy people, planets, solar systems—you name it.\n\nThere are six Infinity Stones: The Space Stone (blue), the Reality Stone (red), the Power Stone (purple), the Mind Stone (yellow), the Time Stone (green) and the Soul Stone (orange).\n\nAs Benicio Del Toro’s The Collector explains inGuardians of the Galaxy, six singularities existed before the creation of the Universe. The Big Bang transformed those entities into six separate Infinity Stones.\n\nSo glad you asked. This can get confusing because many of these stones have two different names. Here’s a rundown of all the Infinity Stone names and what movies they’ve popped up in.\n\nThe Space Stone gives the user power over space. Anyone holding the Space Stone can create a portal from one part of the universe to another. In the Marvel films, the Space Stone is hidden inside a blue cube called the Tesseract.\n\nThe evil organization HYDRA used the Tesseract to power their weapons during World War II inCaptain America: The First Avenger, but the Tesseract fell out of a plane being piloted by Captain America at the end of that movie. We find out the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recovered the Tesseract from the plane during the end credits ofThor.\n\nInCaptain Marvel, which isset in the 1990s, a Kree scientist named Mar-Vell (Annette Bening) harnesses the power of the Tesseract to create an engine that can power ships to travel at light speed. Before Mar-Vell is killed by her own people, she hides the Tesseract on a ship in space. Carol Danvers (a.k.a. Captain Marvel, played by Brie Larson) recovers the Tesseract, and her feline sidekick Goose (who is actually analien called a Flerken) carries it to the office of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) at S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nIn the firstAvengersmovie, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steals the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D. and uses it to open a portal to space. An alien army streams through the portal to invade Earth. At the end of the movie, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) takes the Tesseract to his home planet of Asgard for safe keeping.\n\nInThor: Ragnarok, Thor realizes he must destroy Asgard to defeat theGoddess of Death, Hela(Cate Blanchett). As he and a cohort of sidekicks fight Hela, a supposedly reformed Loki sneaks down to the treasure room where the Tesseract (and therefore the Space Stone) is kept. We never see him grab the stone, but that dude just cannot resist creating chaos. He probably pocketed it. In thepost-credit scenes forThor: Ragnarok, we find out that someone attacked Thor’s getaway ship. InInfinity War, Thanos kills Loki and takes the Space Stone.\n\nThe Mind Stone allows the user to control the minds of others. We first see it as a blue orb in Loki’s scepter in 2012’sThe Avengers. Whenever Loki touches someone with the scepter, he can control what they do. Thanos gives the Mind Stone to Loki, which placesa lotof faith in Loki, a hilarious but not particularly accomplished villain. Weird decision, Thanos.\n\nThe Avengers recover Loki’s scepter at the beginning ofAvengers: Age of Ultron.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) use the Mind Stone to create Ultron (James Spader), an artificially intelligent peace-keeping program. Apparently, those two have not readFrankensteinbecause they’re super surprised when Ultron turns on them.\n\nAfter some bickering, the Avengers eventually use the Mind Stone to create another android, Vision (Paul Bettany). The stone gives Vision a lot of powers, including super-strength, the ability to fly and the power to phase through walls and people like a ghost. Curiously, it does not give him the ability to control minds.\n\nThe Mind Stone resides in Vision’s forehead, and the Avengers vow to protect the superhero. But when Thanos’ army overtakes Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) destroys the stone, killing Vision in the process. Thanos (who has already acquired the Time Stone at this point), simply reverses time, kills Vision and takes the stone for himself.\n\nThe Reality Stone grants the user power to manipulate matter. InThor: The Dark Worldthe villain Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) wants to use this red liquid stuff called Aether to turn matter into dark matter because he’s evil…and do you really need a better reason? It turns out that the Aether is a manifestation of the Reality Stone.\n\nAt the end of the movie, two Asgardians give the Reality Stone to The Collector because apparently they can’t keep the Space Stone and Reality Stone in the same room in Asgard. This seems to be a huge mistake: As soon as they leave the Collector says, “One down, five to go” in a super evil voice.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the Collector gave up the stone immediately to Thanos or whether Thanos killed Del Toro’s character: When the Guardians of the Galaxy arrive to take the Reality Stone from the Collector, Thanos reveals that he has beaten them to their goal. He then takes Gamora hostage.\n\nThe Power Stone bestows upon its holder a lot of energy—the sort of energy that you could use to destroy an entire planet. Star Lord (Chris Pratt) accidentally discovers the stone inGuardians of the Galaxy. Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) steals it from him and threatens to wipe out an entire race.\n\nBut here’s the tricky thing about Infinity Stones: You can’t hold them in your hand for long without dying. (More on that later.) Peter steals the stone back from Ronan and almost dies when holding it. (All the Guardians join hands, and together they can manage its power. Hooray for teamwork!)\n\nThe Guardians—you may start to notice a theme here—give it to Nova Corps, the space police, for safekeeping. The officers in Nova Corps are pretty bad at their jobs. And sure enough, by the opening scenes ofInfinity War, Thanos has already acquired the Power Stone offscreen. Thor later explains that Thanos decimated the planet of Xandar and took it for himself.\n\nThe Time Stone grants its owner the power to re-wind or fast-forward time. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) discovers it in the Eye of Agomoto pendant in the library of Kamar-Taj, where he trains in the mystic arts inDoctor Strange.He uses the stone at the end of the film to trap the villain Dormammu in a time loop so that Dormammu can’t destroy the Earth.\n\nWisely, Doctor Strange doesn’t hand over the stone to a sketchy junk collector or a hapless policeman and decides to watch over it himself. He returns the Stone to Kamar-Taj, where he currently resides, at the end of the movie.\n\nDoctor Strange wears the Time Stone throughoutInfinity Warand even tells Iron Man that if he has to choose between giving up the stone and saving the lives of the Avengers, he’ll prioritize the stone. Later, he uses the power of the Time Stone to look into the many possible futures at the end of theInfinity War.He gleans that he will have to give up the stone to Thanos in order for the Avengers to eventually defeat the Mad Titan. He does so anddisintegrates when Thanos snaps his fingers.\n\nInInfinity War, Thanos travels with Gamora to the planet Vormir, where the Soul Stone is kept. Therethey encounter Red Skull, the villain from the first Captain America movie, who has been doomed to guard but not use the Soul Stone after trying to handle the Space Stone himself. Red Skull tells Thanos that he needs to sacrifice something he loves to attain the gem, and Thanos kills Gamora.\n\nIt’s unclear what the Soul Stone’s powers are in the film universe. In the comics, the gem allows the holder to capture and control others’ souls. It also creates a separate universe where the person who wields it can trip souls. It’s possible that the people who turned to dust at the end ofInfinity Warmay simply reside in this alternate universe created by the stone.\n\nYou can’t hold an Infinity Stone for very long without dying. Just look at what happened to Red Skull. That’s why the Time Stone is in a necklace, the Mind Stone in a scepter, the Space Stone in the Tesseract, etc. Thanos needs to wear a special golden glove to hold all the stones.\n\nThe Infinity Gauntlet. Basically, it’s a fancy golden glove that can hold all the Infinity Stones. When all the stones are united in the Gauntlet, the wearer wields unlimited power.\n\nWe first see the Infinity Gauntlet in the treasure room of Asgard in the firstThor.But then we see the glove again in apost-credits scene fromAvengers: Age of Ultron. After Ultron fails to destroy the Avengers (and humanity), Thanos enters a place that is decidedly not the Asgardian treasure room, puts on the Infinity Gauntlet and says, “Fine, I’ll do it myself.”\n\nMarvel cleared up this confusion about the two Infinity Gauntlets inThor: Ragnarokwhen the villain Hela walks through the Asgardian treasury, looks at the Infinity Gauntlet,tosses it asideand declares it “fake.”\n\nIn the comics, Thanos falls in love with Death (or her physical embodiment) and collects the Infinity Stones to destroy universes and impress her. Marvel Studios hinted at this plotline way back in 2012 when a henchman told Thanos to fight the Avengers is to “court death.” Thanos smiles.\n\nButInfinity War’s writers must have changed their mind about the villain’s motivations after they filmed that scene. InInfinity War, Thanos is concerned with the overpopulation of the universe. His solution is to “restore balance” by killing off half of all the living things. “He’s evil” is another acceptable answer.\n\nThanos sent Ronan the Accuser and Loki to fetch Infinity Stones and wound up empty handed both times. He seems to be making much quicker progress by just tracking down the darn things himself. So laziness, I guess?\n\n2018, whenInfinity Wartook place, also happened to be an opportune time to attack earth, what with the Avengers team broken up.\n\nOh, yeah. If you didn’t catchCaptain America: Civil War, you may want to go back and watch it beforeEndgame. You can stream it on Netflix right now.\n\nHere’s a quick summary: Iron Man and Captain America feud over whether the government should regulate superheroes (Iron Man is for and Cap against). The rest of the Avengers take sides, minus Hulk and Thor who are too busytesting their gladiatorial skills in space. Things end badly, and Iron Man and Cap still aren’t speaking. Their breakup makes Thanos’ job all the easier.\n\nAs ofInfinity War, Captain America and Iron Man still have not united. Iron Man considered calling Cap when Thanos first landed on earth but got distracted by a mission into space to save Doctor Strange. Now, Iron Man is stuck in space, while Captain Marvel is marshaling the Avengers’ remaining forces on Earth post-snap.\n\nProbably not. Spider-Man disappeared inInfinity Warbut has asolo sequel filmpremiering shortly afterEndgame. And the supposedly deadBlack Pantherhas another movie in the workstoo.\n\nAlso note that the superheroes who did survive the culling are all part of the original Avengers team: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Most likely, this movie will be the last time that the original team fights together. They will try to find a way to undo Thanos’ destruction, probably using theQuantum Realmto time travel.\n\nDefinitely.\n\nSeveral actors’ contracts are up after this film, including Chris Evans (Captain America), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) and Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow). Evanshas been very openabout the fact that he’s ready to leave the franchise.HemsworthandDowneyhave also hinted they are done, too.\n\nBut good news: Johansson will probably survive, since Marveljust hired a writerto draft a Black Widow solo flick. Actors newer to the franchise like Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther), Tom Holland (Spider-Man) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange) are also probably safe.\n\nTo its credit, Marvel has just decided to lean into the whole “Cap or Iron Man is probably going to bite it” narrative. Feige has openly said some characters will get to ride off into the sunset, and some will meet a bloody end. It’s just a matter of whether or not that will happen inAvengers: Endgame, which hits theaters April 26.\n\nWrite toEliana Docktermanateliana.dockterman@time.com",

He intended to destroy the universe by using the Soul gems to destroy the stars. He was stopped by theAvengers, Adam Warlock andCaptain Marvel.[10][11]\n\nTheElders of the Universewere the second entities to use the gems in unison. Connecting the six Soul Gems to a device, they were able to use its beams to absorb the life energy ofGalactusand transfer it to a barren planet, giving it life. However, theSilver Surferinterfered and destroyed the machine, and the gems were lost in ablack hole.[12]Galactus also punished some of the Elders by consuming them.[13]\n\nBecause the Elders of the Universe were barred from entering Death's realm due to prior machinations of the Grandmaster, Galactus soon found himself being poisoned from within by the Elders he consumed.[14]To save Galactus, who asserted that only one of the gems had the power to absorb the immortal Elders' souls inside his body, Silver Surfer, Mr. Fantastic, and the Invisible Woman journeyed through the black hole to recover the gems, where Invisible Woman became possessed by the sentient Soul Gem and had her evil Malice persona awakened.[15]She was later subdued, but the whole scheme turned out to be work of theIn-Betweenerso he could use the gems to destroy Galactus.[16]\n\nThe gems' original shape and color\n\nReed, Sue, and the Silver Surfer were able to get into contact withMaster OrderandLord Chaos, and the two entities agreed to aid them in stopping the In-Betweener. They then used their powers to free the Elders of the Universe who were trapped inside Galactus and restore him to full strength.[17]Master Order and Lord Chaos then dealt with the In-Betweener before he caused any more trouble and entrusted five of the Soul Gems to the Elders of the Universe, while the In-Betweener was imprisoned by his masters and retained his Gem.[18]\n\nAfter being resurrected, Thanos gazed into theInfinity Welland realized the Gems' true nature, so he set out to acquire all of the Soul Gems again (now named Infinity Gems). There it was revealed that the Infinity Gems are the remnants ofone of the earliest beings from the time of the universe's creation. Feeling lonely, it split itself into six different fragments. Under unknown reasons, each individual gem became associated with a particular facet: power, space, time, mind, soul and reality.[19]\n\nPrevious owners\n\nThe Infinity Gems were kept by the In-Betweener and by members of the Elders of the Universe who, on the contrary, were not aware of the true essence of their Gems.[20]The mad Titan Thanos then gathered these gems into theInfinity Gauntlet. He took the Soul Gem from theIn-Betweener, the Power Gem from theChampion, the Time Gem from theGardener, the Reality Gem from theCollector, the Space Gem from theRunner, and the Mind Gem from theGrandmaster.[19]\n\nThanos used the Infinity Gauntlet to remove from existence half of the population of the universe in order to gainDeath's love.[21]In the end, Thanos was defeated when Adam Warlock was able to gain possession of the Infinity Gauntlet.[22]\n\nAdam Warlock was brought before theLiving Tribunalbecause of the danger posed by the Infinity Gauntlet in his hand. After being shown that Adam Warlock was too mentally unpredictable, he was required to surrender it. Since it was too dangerous for it to be possessed by anyone, the Living Tribunal decreed that the Infinity Gems were too powerful to be used together again. Warlock then formed theInfinity Watch.[23]\n\nDuring theInfinity War,Magus, Adam Warlock's evil persona, tricked Galactus into convincingEternityto agree to the activation of the Infinity Gauntlet so he could conquer the universe. Magus defeated the heroes using the activated Infinity Gauntlet. Still, Adam was able to defeat the Magus when it was revealed that the Reality Gem was a fake and Adam, taking advantage of this distraction, was able to trap the Magus in his Soul Gem, though the act left Warlock in a comatose state.[24]\n\nThe Gems were later stolen by thevampireRunefrom the Ultraverse and dispersed throughout the Ultraverse.[25]Several heroes and villains were also pulled into the Ultraverse, including Adam Warlock. In that universe, another gem, theEgo Gem, was found. It claimed that it was the main consciousness of the Infinity Gems, the original being and was now ready to reclaim itself. The gems gestated asNemesis, but were defeated by theAvengersandUltraForce(alongside several alternate reality versions of the same teams). With its defeat, the Ego Gem was seemingly destroyed.[26][27]\n\nThe gems were found to be back in the universe byGalactuswho planned on using them to end his unending hunger. He is seen taking the gems off a vampire's skeleton (presumably Rune) that he retrieves through an inter-dimensional portal. Galactus' plan fails, and instead allows a deadly inter-dimensional parasite, namedHunger, access into the Earth-616 universe who was mentally influencing Galactus' actions all along. Thanos intervened and destroyed the gateway. After Hunger is defeated, the gems are scattered throughout the universe except for the Soul Gem, which Thanos retrieved for Warlock to get back.[28]\n\nChampionwould find thePower Stoneand use it to give him an advantage over challengers he fought in his arena but agreed to stop using it whenShe-Hulktold him its a weapon, which weren't allowed during his challenges.[29]The Power Gem later fell into the hands ofTitania,[30]before being taken byShe-Hulk.[31]\n\nShe-Hulk turned the Power Gem over toMister Fantasticfor safekeeping, which prompted Reed to seek help from his fellowIlluminatito gather the remaining gems with the objective to ensure they wouldn't cause any more trouble for the Earth. Once the gems were all brought together in the Infinity Gauntlet, Reed tried to will them out of existence, but failed.Uatu the Watcherthen appeared to the Illuminati and expressed his disappointment in Reed and the Illuminati. The Illuminati then divided the gems amongst themselves. Of the Gems,Iron Manreceived Reality,Prof. XavierMind,NamorTime,Black BoltSpace,Dr. StrangeSoul, andReed RichardsPower. Due to the events following the gathering of the Gems, the Illuminati disbanded for a time.[32]\n\nAfterThe Hoodstole three of the Gems, and while looking for the fourth one, the Illuminati gathered once more and, with the Avengers' help, stopped him. After recovering once more the six Infinity Gems, they again divided the Gems among themselves (this time, Namor received the Power; Mister Fantastic, the Reality; Professor Xavier, the Mind;Captain America, the Time; Iron Man, the Space; and Dr. Strange, the Soul gems) and disbanded once more.[33]\n\nThe group assembled after theBlack Pantherdiscovered that the Earth was affected by theincursions, a multiversal phenomena that caused the periodical collision between realities.[34]In an attempt to stop the the latest incursion, the Illuminati assembled the Infinity Gauntlet. Even though Captain America managed to prevent the incursion, all the gems shattered, with the exception of the Time Gem, which simply vanished.[1]\n\nThe Time Gem unexpectedly returned some time later and transported the Avengers through time.[35]During each time jump, the Gem returned more of the heroes back to the present until only Captain America remained,[36][37]who was rescued byIron Lad.[38]Following a confrontation against Iron Lad and his future counterparts,Kang the ConquerorandImmortus, Captain America retrieved the Time Gem and used it to return to the present, though it vanished again afterwards.[39]\n\nNew colors,Eighth Cosmos\n\nFollowing thedestruction of the entire Multiverse and its eventual restoration, the destroyed Infinity Gems were recreated and scattered across the universe. TheCollectorand theGrandmasterallied themselves with theGuardians of the Galaxyto find the stones, as they believed they held the key to learn more about the destruction and restoration of the universe. This was because from the point of view of its inhabitants, this process occurred in a blink and went mostly unnoticed, and only powerful beings such as theElderscould sense traces of the mysterious re-ordering the cosmos had suffered.[40]\n\nThe Reality Stone (until then colored purple) emerged inWeirdworld, a sequestered dimension where it was known as the Wuxian Seed.[41][42]After being shattered in a dispute for its possession, the Reality Stone took the form of a dragon-shaped aether and fled from Weirdworld.[42]It re-emerged (now colored red) in a universe that was a dark mirror of Earth-616,[43]where it was later found and claimed byCaptain Marvel.[44]\n\nThe Space (now colored blue) and the Mind Stone (now colored yellow) resurfaced on Earth. The former appeared mysteriously in a S.H.I.E.L.D. storage facility, with a failed attempt fromLoki's part to retrieve it resulting in the gem ending up in the hands ofLogan.[45]The latter ended up in possession of petty crookTurk Barrett, who started using it to serve his own needs.[44]\n\nThe remaining three stones appeared scattered throughout the universe. The Power Stone (now colored purple) manifested in a giant-size in the desert planet ofXitaung, where it was found by theNova Corps.[46]The Time Stone (now colored green) restored the ruined planet ofSakaar, where it was later found by theSuper-Skrull,[47]who planned to use the Infinity Stones to remedy the humiliation theSkrull Empirehad suffered over the years. Finally, the Soul Stone (now colored orange) was located by the Magus after he forced theContemplatorto show him where it was. Magus didn't get to enjoy his success for long asUltron/Hank Pymambushed and killed him so he could claim the gem for himself, since he intended to assemble the Infinity Gauntlet and rewrite the universe.\n\nThe Infinity Stones quickly changed of owners. Logan left the Space Stone under the care ofBlack Widow;[44]the Power Stone was reduced to a handheld-size and claimed byStar-Lord;[48]the Time Stone was stolen from the Super-Skrull byDoctor Strange;[49]and finally, the Soul Gem was retrieved from Ultron's hands byWarlockwithKang's help.[50]Kang had enlisted Warlock to stop the imminent calamity caused by whomever gathered the Infinity Stones in the future.[51]\n\nGamora with the Infinity Stones\n\nAfter learning that the other Infinity Stones were on the move, Doctor Strange convened a meeting between its wielders to assemble a newInfinity Watch. The parley which took place onEarthwas interrupted byGamora, who had stolen the Power Stone from Star-Lord and used it to wage war against the other stone wielders. Gamora planned to claim all the Infinity Stones as part of a plan to reunite with a fragment of herself trapped inside the Soul Gem.[52]In the end, Gamora emerged victorious and got hold of all the stones.[53]\n\nTo prevent opposition from her quest and to feed the beingDevondra, who was responsible for the Soul Gem's hungering for souls, Gamora used the Infinity Stones to fold the universe in half and merge the two halves together before sending the new universe into a pocket dimension calledWarp Worldinside the Soul Gem. Gamora planned to create a reality once Devondra devoured all the souls inside the Soul Gem. She also sealedLokiinto the Soul Gem when he asked to be her counsel. Gamora then traveled to theGod Quarryto investigate what laid beneath it as she couldn't see past it.[54]\n\nGamora was unable to breach the barrier at the bottom of the God Quarry,[55]and she was eventually confronted by Loki and his newly assembledCosmic Avengers. Gamora had unintentionally created copies of the Infinity Stones when she brought Warp World into existence, and the Cosmic Avengers used them to escape the Soul Gem. Loki's team subdued Gamora and took the Power, Reality and Space Stones from her. Loki in turn took these stones for himself in addition to the copies of the Soul, Time and Mind Stones, thus assembling a complete set of Infinity Stones. He used the stones to send Gamora to Warp World before transporting himself to the unknown realm that existed beneath the Quarry of Creation, where he found the group of Celestials that guarded the deposit of Infinity Stones.[5]\n\nWarlock giving sentience to the Infinity Stones\n\nLoki returned from beneath the Quarry of Creation, and used his Infinity Stones to render the surplus gems inert. He handed over his set to the Cosmic Avengers so they could repair the universe. After returning to Soul World and defeating Devondra, the Cosmic Avengers joined forces with Adam Warlock to restore the universe while keeping Warp World intact within the Soul Gem. Adam Warlock then used the Soul Gem to flee Soul World with the Cosmic Avengers and his allies whileDrax the Destroyersacrificed himself to keep the portal leading to the real universe open. After sending Gamora someplace to set her on a path of redemption, Adam Warlock decided to give the Infinity Stones sentience and let them decide their destinies in order to stop the conflicts over their power.\n\nAll Infinity Stones left the Earth,[8]save for the Time Stone, which merged withHector Bautista,[56]and the Reality Stone, which merged withRipley Ryan.[57]It is later revealed that the Power Stone was swallowed byOtheronetherefore merging with it,[58]the Space Stone merged with a man calledQuantum[59]and the Soul Stone bounded to a synthetic person calledMultitude.[60]The Mind Stone choseWorldmind, but he was inevitably killed, leavingColleen Wingto take it.[61]\n\nNebula with the Infinity Gems overpowering the cosmic entities\n\nOn their own, the Infinity Stones provide great power. They form a circuit, meaning that mastery over the aspect of each Infinity Stone allows for better exploit of another. Assembled together, they create a positive feedback loop, granting the user infinite power,[5]although they only work in their native universe.[65][1]The gems are also sentient. In unison, the Gems exceedcosmic beingslikeEternityin power. In fact, the Gems allowedThanos,Nebula, andAdam Warlockto defeat almost all of the universe's major cosmic entities at the same time with ease.[66][67]The only beings that have overcome the Gems together are theLiving Tribunal[67]andGod Emperor Doomvia the power of theBeyonders.[68]\n\nThe Gems give their user virtualomnipotence,[22]as well as omniscience andcosmic awareness.[72]The user gains the power and status of a cosmic being above likes ofDeathand Eternity,[73][74]but below that of the Living Tribunal.[67]Thanos with the Gauntlet was able to usurp Eternity's role in the universe.[74]\n\nIn Battlerealm, Infinity Stones are created by channeling the energies released by the great battles of the Contest of Champions. The convoluted nature of Battlerealm, however, make them unstable and hard to control.\n\nThe first Infinity Stone native to Battlerealm (theGenesis Stone) was created byMaestrofrom the concentratedISO-8dust he left incubating inside the participants of the Contest; the second (called theEvolution Stone) was created from theDarkPhoenix's ISO-Terrigencocoon; the third (named theWar Stone) was created during the battle to preventDormammufrom conquering Battlerealm; and a fourth (theNightmare Stone) was created byM.O.D.O.K.with the help ofTaskmasterusing the data acquired from theSummoner's battles atHotel M.O.D.O.K.\n\nFollowing the Maestro's defeat at his hands,Thanostook the Genesis Stone for himself and went on a quest to acquire the others. After claiming the Evolution Stone, Thanos tried to claim the War Stone as well, butDoctor Strange, who had been investigating the Mad Titan since he vanished with the Genesis Stone, took hold of it first. Under unknown circumstances, Thanos came to be in possession of the Nightmare Stone and theStark Enhanced Spider-Manacquired a new Infinity Stone (theChaos Stone). Thanos tried to steal the Chaos Stone from Spider-Man, but Doctor Strange and other heroes of Battlerealm intervened.\n\nAfter the Infinity Stones were strewn across the Battlerealm once again due to the actions of theBlack Panther, the Goddess of DeathHelasecured the remaining Infinity Stone (theDeath Stone) and gave it to Thanos, who in turn used it to trap most of the heroes of Battlerealm in a lifeless copy of reality to gather the other five stones unopposed.[75]\n\nIn this reality, the Infinity Gems are referred to as \"Inu Abanayyartu\", or simply \"The Stones\". Their powers are unknown but presumably comparable to their multiversal counterparts.[1]\n\nIn this universe, there are eight Infinity Gems instead of six. They were generated on the Earth during great calamities, including the paleolithic extinction event,Ragnarok, theUltimatum, and the sinking of Atlantis and Lemuria, as some sort of scar tissue to help the planet.[76]\n\nFour of them were inS.H.I.E.L.D.custody.[77]A green (possibly theSoul Gem) and a purple gem (possibly theSpace Gem) were attached to aglove.[78]TheMind Gemwas stored apart inProject Pegasus, from where it was stolen byModi,[79]though it was ultimately retrieved.[80]ThePower Gemwas contained in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s The Torch facility in Sioux City, and it was stolen by Hydra double-agentCommander Crimson.[81]\n\nAfter the events centered around the Mind Gem, theInvisible Womanlearned about the other two gems in the gauntlet. She noticed the glove was designed to hold four gems, so she set out to find the fourth Gem before it fell in wrong hands.[77]Sue tried to study the gems in order to track down the fourth one, but found their spectrum analysis was inconsistent. Thor tried to talk to the gems as if they were sentient, demanding the location of the others, causing him and Sue to be teleported to a Hydra research base in New Mexico.[78]After fighting through Hydra troops, Sue discovered another gauntlet containing the fourth gem, with space for three more stones.[81]\n\nMeanwhile, the Power Gem was used by Commander Crimson to fend off her Nebraska outpost against theUltimates. An energy surge from the Gem caused Commander Crimson to disintegrate, and the gem to melt the ground and fall straight down into Earth's core.[81]The gem recovered from the New Mexico Hydra lab generated rhythmic pulsar blasts that pointed at the Moon, prompting Sue and Thor to travel there.[82]Even though they were faced by theBlack Knightof theWest Coast Ultimates,[83]the Invisible Woman managed to retrieve the Gem.[84]\n\nTheSue Stormof analternate future, who called herselfKang, traveled back in time from the destruction of her reality to the present, convinced that she would need the Infinity Gems to prevent the cataclysm she escaped from.[85]She freedHulk, andthe Makerfrom imprisonment, with the help ofQuicksilver.\n\nKang'sDark Ultimatesstruck when the present Sue Storm was briefing the rest of the Ultimates on the five Gems that had been acquired. Hulk destroyed theTriskelionand got hold of the Gems, while Quicksilver retrieved the sixth gem from the ruins of the Maker's Dome.[76]\n\nUsing the power of the almost-finishedInfinity Gauntlets, the Dark Ultimates began to reshape the world their image. As part of a desperate attempt to stand against the Dark Ultimates, Tony Stark tinkered a glove theoretically capable of attracting and containing the Power Gem that became buried underneath Nebraska. Before he could use it, Stark was neutralized by Quicksilver, because he possessed inside his brain the final Infinity Gem.[86]\n\nIron Man gets hold of the Infinity Gems\n\nReed surgically removed the Gem from Tony's brain,[87]and apprehendedJohnny Stormfrom a hospital, brainwashed him, and used his capacity to sustain enormous temperatures to retrieve the Power Gem from Earth's core.[88]After recovering the Power Gem, Pietro collected it from Johnny to hand it over to Reed. Kang had to take the Gem forcefully from Pietro, who had realized Reed planned on eradicating mutantkind when he completed the Infinity Gauntlet.[89]\n\nThe Ultimates and theHowling Commandoswere confronting Reed when Kang arrived with the Gem in order to complete the Gauntlets. They fought for the grasp of the final Gem. Kang tried to convince Reed that she needed to have the Gauntlet, otherwise the universe would end. Thanks to the intervention of Johnny Storm, who had snapped out of the brainwash, the gems fell in Iron Man's possession. In the very next moment, a tear in the fabric of reality caused by aWolverineechoed through the Multiverse, and shattered the Infinity Gems.[85]\n\nTheAvengersfirst became aware of the existence of the Infinity Stones (as they are called, instead of Gems) after theRed Skullescaped from his masterThanoswith them. The stones (excluding the Soul stone) were scattered all over the Earth shortly before his ship crashed inBrazil. He managed to maintain hold of only one of the five Infinity Stones, thePower Stone. The Avengers intercepted the Red Skull and obtained of the Power Stone, and they reactivated a secret robot created byHoward StarknamedArsenalto contain its energy in another dimension.[90]The appearance of the Stone in the Earth brought the attention of Thanos, who faced the Avengers and took the Power Stone from them, but he was subsequently blasted \"half way across the universe.\"[91]\n\nThe other four Infinity Stones were later found by the Avengers. The Time Stone was captured after fluctuating through time, and it was temporarily lodged in Iron Man'sarc reactor;[92]the Mind Stone had been seized byM.O.D.O.K., who used it to take control of S.H.I.E.L.D. and briefly switch the minds of the Avengers between each other;[93]the Reality Stone was used by theSquadron Supreme, who altered reality to their whim, but they were stopped by the Avengers;[94]and the Space Stone, which fell in possession ofLoki, who tried to use it to merge theNine Realmsand escapeValhalla.[95]\n\nAll of the four Stones were contained in the Avengers Tower, under special care by Tony Stark. However, Black Widow noticed that Tony was slowly being corrupted by the Stones. She sneaked into the vault containing the Stones and stole them with the intention to hand them over to Thor so he could take for safekeeping toAsgard. After escaping from the rest of the Avengers, who believed her to be a traitor, Widow was accompanied by Thor to Asgard, but even before handing the Stones over toHeimdall, he was corrupted, and they were forced to return to the Earth.\n\nThe duo was intercepted by theGuardians of the Galaxy, who came to the Earth to claim the stones for safekeeping. Black Widow didn't trust them with the Stones, and confronted them. The Avengers arrived to protect her, as they had realized she was right. After the Guardians were dealt with, the Avengers visitedDoctor Strange, so he could bury the Stones between realms.Dormammuarrived subsequently in order to claim the Stones, and Black Widow was forced to wield them in order to vanish him back to his dimension. After initially falling into the Stones' influence, Natasha was capable of resisting their control and reject them. However, as soon as she stripped of the Stones,Thanosreturned, and assembled theInfinity Gauntletwith the Power Stone that was already in his possession.[96]\n\nUsing the Gauntlet, Thanos created a citadel near Earth's orbit. The Avengers attempted to stop him, but the Mad Titan ignored them as he used the Gauntlet to modify Earth's climate, causing earthquakes, ice ages, and other anomalies around the globe. As part of a contingency plan, the Avengers needed to get the readings of each stone individually. By attacking Thanos' ego, they got him to use each stone alone to fight them. He first aged the Avengers until they died with the Time Stone, but Thor forced him to reverse time after causing the Titan's energy beam to backfire, aging him. After bringing them back, he used the Mind Gem to fuel them with anger and make them fight each other, however, Hulk managed to get them to focus their rage and attack Thanos, for which the Titan decided to stop its influence over them. Using the Space Gem, he attacked each Avenger by teleporting immediately after striking. Even after Hawkeye and Black Widow found the pattern of his attacks in order to avoid them, Thanos used the Reality Gem and incapacitated the Avengers, by making them see a reality where global peace was achieved. Captain America managed to see through this lie, and freed the Avengers from its influence. Once the Avengers stroke back, Thanos used the Power Stone to fight them.\n\nAfter the Avengers restrained him, Thanos decided to stop following their game, and reactivated all of the Gauntlet's power at once. He used the Gauntlet to destroy Iron Man, but it was revealed the armor was being controlled remotely, and Stark was in the Avengers Tower, using the readings of each individual stone to putArsenalback online. Thanos brought Stark's lab to his citadel, but he rebooted Arsenal, who proceeded to fight Thanos. Arsenal absorbed any attack from Thanos, and finally took the Gauntlet from him. Using the Gauntlet, Arsenal brought Thanos and the Avengers back to Earth, where the team proceeded to defeat the Mad Titan.\n\nWhen Iron Man tried to retrieve the Gauntlet from the hands of Arsenal, the robot denied Tony's action. It was revealed a backdoor left in the robot's programming allowedUltronto possess him. Arsenal was re-shaped into Ultron, and the evil A.I. revealed itself. The five Stones were drained of their power by Ultron.[97]It was later revealed that the power of the stones that were absorbed into Arsenal's pocket dimension had manifest into living copies of the Avengers that share similar memories and personalities as the originals, each capable of using a respected power of the Infinity Stones.[98]\n\nThe Soul Stone was placed onAdam Warlock's forehead, and appeared to turn dark whenever he started to exhibit negative emotions. It was the only stone Thanos did not use alongside the others on his gauntlet.[citation needed]\n\nIn this reality, the Infinity Stones were involved in one ofThanosschemes, in which he was turned into dust. Thanos came back to life and start to wore the Infinity Stones as rings, known as the Infinity Rings.[2]During Thanos' fight againstDr. Spectrum, the latter blow off Thanos's right hand with the rings.[99]\n\nSimilar to Earth-616,Thanoshad gathered the Infinity Gems and attempted to use the Infinity Gauntlet to rule the universe, but is stopped by a group of heroes.\n\nIn a later appearance, the Infinity Gems are referred to as the Infinity Stones.UltronandSigmaused the Reality and Space Stones to combine their worlds, also fusing themselves intoUltron Sigma. The remaining stones were gathered by the heroes and used to destroy Ultron Sigma with theInfinity Buster. AfterwardsThordecided that there should be six custodians to the Infinity Stones, two being entrusted to Earth, two to Xgard, and two to the Dark Kingdom.[100]\n\nThanos first obtained the Soul Stone fromAdam Warlock. He received the Time Stone from the center force field. Thanos received the Mind Stone from theGrandmasterafter the Super Hero Squad bested the Squadron Supreme in a contest. The Space Stone was found on an asteroid but was stolen byNebulaand he later took it back from her. He received the Power Stone from Nova. After the scuffle Nova used a teleporter to send the stone far away into the deepest depths of space. Thanos took the Reality Stone from the Collector and used it to get the Power Stone back. When the Silver Surfer offered Thanos theInfinity Sword, he took the Gauntlet and used the Soul Stone to trap Thanos. Using its power, the Silver Surfer became the Dark Surfer and used the Gauntlet's powers to scatter the Squaddies across six different dimensions. Afterwards, he used them to rip the Earth out of orbit. In the final battle the Surfer split himself into six differently colored copies each color corresponding with a different Infinity Stone and prepared to fight the Squaddies. As shown, each Hero Factor countered a specific Infinity Stone. After the Squaddies defeated him, the Dark Surfer sent the stones and the sword to the Infinity Pool. The Sword and the Stones were shattered into fractals once Doom and Iron Man fought. The fractals fixed what the Dark Surfer did to the Universe, and freed the beings trapped within the Soul Stone.\n\nThe factors that counter each Infinity Stone are:\n\nIn order to defeat the Mad TitanThanos,Anwen Bakianused the Reality Stone to create theDeath Stone. Looking identical to the Reality Stone, Bakian handed it over to an unaware Thanos, where it promptly disintegrated him.[101]\n\nIn theMarvel Cinematic Universe, the Infinity Gems are referred to as the Infinity Stones, which are theSpace Stone, theReality Stone, thePower Stone, theMind Stone, theTime Stone, and theSoul Stone.\n\nThe Infinity Stones in their original forms\n\nAccording to theCollector, the Infinity Stones were six different singularities existing before the beginning of the universe. Once the universe was created, they were scattered. The Stones, which could be remolded only by powerful creatures, were first used by theCelestials, who used them to grant their race unknowable power, and dominate several planets. At some point, the Celestials lost control of the Stones, and they fell into the hands of other races, such as theAsgardiansand theDark Elves.[102]\n\nTheSpace Stoneis able to generate an infinite amount of energy and generate portals to other locations and gives off a blue light. Residing in a cube known as theTesseract, it was once possessed by the Asgardians and was described as being the jewel ofOdin's treasury, but the item was eventually left onMidgard.[103]\n\nIn March 1942, duringWorld War II, theRed Skull, the leader of the Nazi deep science organizationHydra, located and retrieved the Tesseract from a church inTønsberg,Norway. With the help of his head scientist,Arnim Zola, the Red Skull used the Tesseract to supply power for the weapons used by his Hydra soldiers. Hydra's plans were foiled whenCaptain Americaand theSSRattacked Hydra's main location. The Red Skull tried to flee with the Tesseract, but Captain America was able to board his plane before it took off. When the two fought, the Red Skull was knocked into the Tesseract, causing it to react violently. The Red Skull vanished entirely when he handled the Tesseract directly, causing it to open a dimensional portal, and the object then melted through the aircraft and fell into the ocean. Captain America crashed the plane in theArctic Circle, andHoward Starkrecovered the Tesseract from the ocean floor while searching for him.[103]\n\nIn 1995, the Tesseract was studied in theProject Pegasusmilitary base byMar-Vell, in the disguise of Dr. Wendy Lawson. She and USAF pilotCarol Danverswere testing an experimental jet remotely powered by the Tesseract. The jet was attacked by the Kree, and Carol was irradiated by the blast of the destroyed engine, which gave her super powers. The Tesseract was swallowed by aFlerken, which came under the care ofNick Fury.[104]\n\nThe Tesseract remained in the custody ofS.H.I.E.L.D.(the successor organization to the SSR) until the early 21st century, when a fight between theDestroyerandThordevastated theNew Mexicotown ofPuente Antiguo.[105]Now aware of the existence of advanced extraterrestrials and fearing the threats they posed, S.H.I.E.L.D. tasked astrophysicistErik Selvigwith studying the Tesseract, hoping they could use it to develop weapons. In the following year, the rogue AsgardianLokistole the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D. forThanosin exchange for aChitauriarmy he could use to subjugate Earth. In response to losing the Tesseract, S.H.I.E.L.D. DirectorNick Furyassembled a group of heroes known as theAvengers- Captain America,Iron Man, Thor,Black Widow,Hawkeyeandthe Hulk- to stop Loki and retrieve the Tesseract. Loki had Erik Selvig, who he had hypnotized into doing his bidding, construct a device that harnessed the Tesseract's power to create a hole in space overNew Yorkfor the Chitauri to invade through. The Avengers were able to stop Loki's plans, destroy his machine, and repel the Chitauri invasion.[106]\n\nAfter the Battle of New York, Thor took the Tesseract back to Asgard,[106]andHeimdallused its power to restore theBifrost.[107]Eventually, Loki went to retrieve the Tesseract before placing the skull ofSurturinto theEternal Flamein order to startRagnarok.[108]A short time later, Thanos and theBlack Orderattacked the ship that the Asgardians had escaped on, and Loki handed over the Tesseract so that Thanos would not kill Thor.[109]\n\nTheReality Stoneis capable of warping reality to the user's desires. It was transformed into a weapon known as theAetherbyMalekith, leader of theDark Elves, who sought to use the Aether to conquer the Nine Realms before he was stopped by the Asgardian kingBor. Malekith and a small number of his followers escaped into the dark reaches of space, while Bor had the Aether hidden away to ensure that it would never be found. The Aether was later reactivated byJane Foster, who found the Stone through an anomaly inLondon, and it bonded to her. Thor brought Jane back to Asgard for her to be treated, but the realm was attacked by an awakened Malekith and his Dark Elves seeking to regain control of their weapon. The Dark Elves were repelled, but the Asgardians suffered heavy losses. Thor decided to take the fight to the Dark Elves by taking Jane and Loki with him to Svartalfheim, where Malekith extracted the Aether from Jane and bonded it to himself. Even with the Aether bonded to him, Malekith was defeated by Thor and his human allies during the convergence.[107]\n\nBelieving that keeping two Infinity Stones in the same place would be too dangerous, the Asgardians left the Aether in the care ofTaneleer Tivan, the Collector.[107]However, Thanos later traveled toKnowherein order to retrieve the Reality Stone, likely killing the Collector as well.[109]\n\nThePower Stonehas the power to destroy any living material to come into contact with it, and emits a violet light. A formerRavagernamedPeter Quill, a.k.a. Star-Lord, found the Power Stone sealed in anOrbon the planetMorag. It is unknown what happened to the Stone between its use by the Celestials and its rediscovery, much less how it wound up on Morag at all. The Stone was sought by the fanaticalKreeAccuserRonan, who agreed to deliver it to Thanos in exchange for the destruction ofXandar, home of theNova Corps, at Thanos' hands. Thanos' adopted daughterGamorawas sent to recover the Orb from Star-Lord, but she planned to betray Ronan and her father by selling it to the Collector to keep it out of their hands. However, Tivan's assistant Carina touches the stone which causes an explosion. After discovering the magnitude of the stone's power, she and Star-Lord chose to take it to the Nova Corps, but Ronan obtained it instead. However, instead of giving the stone to Thanos, Ronan decided to keep it and destroy Xandar himself. After a pitched battle, Star-Lord, Gamora,Rocket, andDrax the Destroyerwere able to separate the stone from Ronan, saving the planet. Before leaving, the newly-minted \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" gave the stone to the Nova Corps for safekeeping.[102]At some later point, Thanos retrieved the Orb and decimated Xandar.[109]\n\nTheMind Stonehas a variety of powers related to the mind, and was initially found encased in a blue crystal on thescepterwhich was given to Loki by Thanos to aid in his invasion of Earth. When removed the gem is revealed to be much smaller and emits a yellow light. Loki used the scepter to control the minds of several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, including Clint Barton and Professor Selvig. The Stone would hypnotize those who had the tip of its edge touched over their heart; however, the contact needed to be immediate, as the Stone's power failed to work on Tony Stark when Loki tapped the scepter on thearc reactorin his chest. Although the Avengers did not realize the scepter contained another Infinity Stone, or even knew what an Infinity Stone was, they recognized that the scepter emitted an energy similar to that of the Tesseract, allowing Black Widow to bypass a failsafe built into the machine Loki used to open a portal for the Chitauri to invade Earth through.[106]\n\nFollowing Loki's defeat, the scepter was kept in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, and was experimented upon by the joint organization's scientists. One scientist,Wolfgang von Strucker, who was a member of the Hydra cell growing within S.H.I.E.L.D. since the end of World War II, had the scepter transferred to his fortress inSokoviabefore Hydra's conspiracy was exposed. Strucker found that the scepter could also augment minds as well as cause spontaneous evolution in varying degrees. Hydra exposed numerous test subjects to the Stone's energy in an attempt to develop superhumans.[110]Only two of Strucker's test subjects survived: the twinsPietroandWanda Maximoff. The experiments gave Pietro a speed physiology, while Wanda was given various psionic abilities not all that dissimilar from the Stone's.[111]The Avengers, who had reunited after the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D., attacked Strucker's fortress once they received intelligence fromPhil Coulsonregarding it and the scepter's location.[112]Iron Man recovered the scepter during the battle and brought it back with him toStark Tower. Tony discovered in Strucker's files that the scepter (in reality, the Mind Stone hidden within) contained the basis for a truly artificial intelligence. Tony Stark and Bruce Banner used the scepter to developUltron, an artificial intelligence that could control theIron Legionmore effectively thanJ.A.R.V.I.S.. However, Ultron turned on his creators the instant he was brought online. Ultron believed the only way to save humanity was to subject them to an extinction-level event, forcing their evolution. The mad A.I. fled Stark Tower with the scepter and returned to Sokovia.\n\nUltron ultimately decided that he, too should evolve. Using the Mind Stone as a base for its intelligence andvibraniumfor the body, Ultron used the Stone's powers to coerce Dr.Helen Chointo using her biotechnology cradle to create a new life form. The Avengers separated Ultron from his new body while he was transferring his intelligence into it. Tony Stark uploaded J.A.R.V.I.S. into the body, but Captain America wanted to destroy it over fears it would turn out like Ultron. The matter was settled when Thor, who had seen the Mind Stone in a vision, used the power ofMjolnirto bring the android to life. Ultron's creation, now called \"theVision,\" had the Mind Stone embedded into his head, and demonstrated his worth to the Avengers when he was able to effortlessly lift Thor's hammer. The Avengers, the Vision and the Maximoff twins, with help from Nick Fury and a team of former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, put an end to Ultron's plans in Sokovia, with the Vision destroying Ultron's final body.\n\nThe Vision was made an official member of the Avengers following the battle. Before returning to Asgard, Thor told Iron Man and Captain America that the android could be entrusted with the Mind Stone.[113]\n\nWhen the Black Order came to Earth in order to retrieve the Mind Stone for Thanos, the Avengers decided to take Vision toWakanda, where they could safely try to remove the stone without risking Vision's life. When Thanos eventually arrived, Vision, realizing that they were out of time, askedWanda Maximoffto destroy the stone, even though it was still inside him. After Wanda destroyed it, Thanos used the Time Stone to reverse time, and took the stone from Vision's head.[109]\n\nTheTime Stone, which emits a green light, allows its user to manipulate time.Stephen Strangeharnessed the Time Stone within theEye of Agamottoto reverse the destructionKaeciliushad caused onHong Kong, and later to forceDormammuto leaving Earth alone by trapping Dormammu in a time loop. As Strange returned the Eye toKamar-Taj,Wongnoted he made a wise choice given the risk of walking around with an Infinity Stone.[114]However, one year later, when Thor first met Strange, he was wearing the Eye of Agamotto, which presumably contained the Time Stone, around his neck.[108]\n\nWhen the Black Order came to Earth in order to retrieve the Time Stone for Thanos, they took Strange, being unable to remove the Eye themselves. After torturing Strange to remove the enchantment on the Eye,Ebony Mawwas sucked into the vacuum of space after being tricked by Tony Stark andPeter Parker. Strange, Tony, and Peter later landed onTitan, where they met Peter Quill, Drax, andMantis. While trying to come up with a plan to defeat Thanos, Strange used the Eye to look forward in time to see over 14 million possible outcomes of the coming conflict, with them only winning in one. When Thanos arrived a battle started between him, Strange, Tony, Parker, Quill, Drax, Mantis, andNebula. Later in the fight, when Thanos was about to kill Tony, Strange handed over the Time Stone in exchange for Tony's life.[109]\n\nTheSoul Stonehas the ability to manipulate life and death. It resided on the planetVormirfor an untold amount of time. Following his attempt to abuse the Tesseract's power, the Red Skull was sent to Vormir and cursed into being the Soul Stone's guardian. At some point, Gamora found a map leading to the stone, but destroyed it so that Thanos couldn't find the stone himself. After Thanos caught Nebula sneaking onto his ship to try and kill him, he looked into Nebula's memory and found out that Gamora knew where the stone was. Thanos later captured Gamora and forced her to reveal the stone's location by torturing Nebula. After revealing that the stone was on Vormir, Gamora was brought there by Thanos to retrieve the Stone. Once they arrived, the Red Skull revealed that in order to retrieve the stone, a loved one must be sacrificed. Thanos, tearfully, sacrificed Gamora, obtaining the stone for himself.[109]\n\nHaving acquired all the stones, Thanos used them to wipe out half of the life in the universe in order to rebalance it. Three weeks later, he used them to destroy themselves, so his work couldn't be undone.\n\nHowever, five years later, the Avengers had the idea to return to different points in the past and find the Infinity Stones again in order to undo the snap. They sent different teams to get theTime, SpaceandMind Stonesin analternate 2012inManhattan, theReality Stonein analternate 2013inAsgardand theSoulandPower Stonesin analternate 2014in space.\n\nHowever, the 2012 team's plan went awry and they had to returnfurther in timein order to acquire the Space Stone andPym Particlesto return to the present.Black Widowhad to sacrifice herself to get the Soul Stone whilea past version of Thanoslearned about his future and captured present Nebula to get there. Back to the present, the Avengers managed to rebuild an Infinity Gauntlet and bring back all the people erased by Thanos five years prior, but past Thanos himself arrived shortly after and announced his intention to acquire the Infinity Stones in order to destroy the universe and recreate so that its inhabitants wouldn't fathom what came before. His plan failed as Iron Man eventually got his hands in the Infinity Stones and erased Thanos and his army at the cost of his own life.\n\nThe past Infinity Stones had to return to their proper periods of time since in case they didn't, they would unbalance the realities from were they came from and create multiple alternate timelines.[115]\n\nIn the universe that is home to the Great Society, the Infiniy Stones take on a different shape. They come in the form of \"Planes of Forever Glass\", six square-shaped panes that come in the same colors of the Stones. When brought together, they form a cube that is called the \"Wishing Box.\" The Box was used by the Great Society to avert anincursion, but the Box and the panes were seemingly destroyed in the process. This is the first instance seen of the Infinity Stones taking on a different shape and name compared to other versions in the multiverse.[3]\n\nWhen theLokiwho used the time traveler intervention to escape in 2012 was taken into custody by theTime Variance Authority, he discovered that the TVA had many Infinity Stones from various erased alternate timelines, all of which were powerless.[116]\n\nOriginally, the Infinity Gems were protected by what would be known as theInfinity Watchafter Adam Warlock won the Infinity Gauntlet and was put on trial by theLiving Tribunal, being found too mentally unstable to handle the power. The Infinity Watch remained until the gems disappeared.[119]Each member was selected by Warlock based on their unwillingness to use the Gem's capabilities or inability to either access any of it's power or full potential.[67]\n\nThe gems were later protected by the Illuminati, and each member was given a gem to hide from anybody else.[32]After the criminalThe Hoodtried to assemble the Infinity Gauntlet, the Illuminati retrieved the Gems, but switched protectors.[33]The use of theInfinity Gauntletto prevent the collision ofEarth-616with another Earth caused all the gems but the Time Gem, which just vanished, to be accidentally destroyed.[1]The Time Gem later reappeared and took theAvengerson a journey through time before disappearing after Captain America used it to return to the present.[122]\n\nFollowing the creation of theEighth Cosmos, the Infinity Stones were scattered across the universe,[40]passing through many hands before finding a group of owners that became the new short-lived Infinity Watch,[52]from whom Gamora stole all of the Infinity Stones:[53]\n\nDuring theInfinity Wars, Gamora created a pocket universe withinSoul WorldcalledWarp World, unwittingly creating duplicates of the Infinity Stones that were collected byLokiandhis allies. These were the final wielders of the Infinity Stones before Adam Warlock granted each gem their own soul so that they could live a life of their own:[5]\n\nThe original colors (from the Seventh Cosmos)",

    "title": "All 7 Infinity Stones Explained: Origin, Powers & Appearances",
    "content": "Infinity Stones are among the most iconic andpowerful weapons in the Marvel Universe. Throughout their long existence, Infinity Stones were at the center of some of thebest Marvel cosmic stories, and most recently, they have been included in the MCU as well, becoming a global phenomenon and something that marked Thanos as one of themost popular villains of all time. Starting the journey, there were six canon Infinity Stones Power Stone, Time Stone, Reality Stone, Soul Stone, Mind Stone, and Space Stone – each controlling one unique aspect of reality and combined together, controlling the reality itself. Recently, Marvel unveiled the existence of the seventh Infinity Stone, the Death Stone.\n\nDue to this, we’ve decided to revisit all seven Infinity Stones, as well as their origin, powers, and colors, to see how they varied over the decades.\n\nSpace Stone, like the rest of the Infinity Stones, was created when an entity called Nemesis, with seemingly incomprehensible powers, committed suicide. The aspects of Nemesis’ powers and personality survived in the form of the six Infinity Stones. The first time we are aware of the existence of Space Stone is when Thanos learns of the location of Space Gem, which was at the time held by a powerful entity known as Xambor.\n\nSpace Stone was part of the famousInfinity Gauntlet storyline, and later, during the Secret Wars storyline, it was destroyed when Captain America used the Infinity Gauntlets. Following the aftermath of the Secret Wars storyline, Space Stone appeared again, albeit in a different color.\n\nRegarding the color of the Space Infinity Stone, originally, it was purple. During the Secret Wars storyline, it was red. After Secret Wars, the Gem was “rebuilt” in blue, which matches the MCU color of the stone. Regarding powers, Space Stone allows its user to manipulate space and utilizeteleportationat an unprecedented level. Due to its space-manipulating properties, one can utilize Space Stone to create black holes and traverse impossible distances that seemingly break the laws of physics.\n\nMind Stone was created simultaneously with the other six Infinity Stones and traced its creation back to the Nemesis. During the Infinity Gauntlet storyline, Thanos dueled the Grandmaster to take the Gem and assemble all six of them in order to manipulate reality. Like the other gems, the Mind Stone was shattered during the Secret Wars storyline and promptly appeared again when reality recovered.\n\nAs the name suggests, the Mind Stone gives its user incredible mental fortitude and greatly increases one’s psionic powers, such as telepathy. The stone works best if the user already has some mental powers at his disposal and also if the stone is used in conjunction with the Soul Stone.\n\nOriginally Mind Stone was blue in color; during the Secret Wars, it was green. The current color of Mind Stone in the comics and in the MCU is yellow.\n\nEven though Soul Stone has the same origin story as the rest of the Infinity Stones, somehow, it ended up in the possession of High Evolutionary.High Evolutionary, in turn, gave the Gem to “Him,” aka Adam Warlock, who promptly used it to help High Evolutionary deal with New Men and other things that posed a danger to Counter-Earth. Soon Adam Warlock discovered that the Soul Gem has a dark side and sometimes acts as a vampiric weapon capable of stealing the souls of other entities and mortals alike.\n\nThanos recovered the Soul Gem from the In-Betweener, and later, the Soul Gem was like the rest of the shattered. In terms of powers, Soul Stone is capable of giving its user control over life and souls. The Gem appears to be sentient in nature and contains an entire dimension within itself called the Soul World. Using the Soul Gem allows its user to read the minds of others as well as transform creatures into their natural forms.\n\nDuring its first appearance in the comics, Soul Stone was green. During the Secret Wars storyline, it was purple, and after rebuilding, it appeared in the same color as its MCU counterpart, orange.\n\nReality Stone found itself in possession of the Collector. Thanos was able to deceive the said Collector by offering him an infant Elder in exchange for what he believed to be a worthless yellow Gem, but then used the Reality Gem to show the Collector its true power and disappeared with the Gem, leaving the Collector surprised and regretful.\n\nAs Thanos learned, The Collector was unable to unlock the powers of the Reality Stone because he lacked the mental properties to do so. Reality Stone manifests its powers only to entities that showcase enough mental fortitude to utilize the stone’s reality-altering powers.\n\nBefore the Secret Wars storyline, the Reality Stone’s powers were generally oriented toward manipulating the laws of physics and creating things and scenarios that are regarded as impossible and to “break the reality,” after the gems were destroyed and rebuilt, the Reality Stone had a brand new set of powers, and nowadays it can be used to tap into the multiverse and spy on other realities. The infinity gem is best used in conjunction with the Time Stone.\n\nOriginally in the comics, Reality Stone appeared as a worthless yellow bauble. Later, it was depicted as blue. In the MCU, the stone is red in color, which corresponds to the color of the current comic as well.\n\nDuring the Infinity Gauntlet storyline, Thanos managed to kill the Gardener in order to acquire the Time Stone. What Gardener wasn’t aware of at the time was that Thanos had Power Stone in his possession, which greatly augments the abilities of Time Gem. When it comes to the origin of the stone, it was created at the same time as the other gems when Nemesis committed suicide. It is interesting that during the Secret Wars, Time Gem was the only Gem that wasn’t “shattered”; instead, it was gone only to reappear again when Reed Richards managed to rebuild reality.\n\nThe Time Stone grants its user complete mastery over time, including the ability to view potential futures, manipulate the aging of beings, and weaponize time to entrap enemies or even worlds in endless loops.\n\nTime Stone was originally orange-colored; surprisingly, the Gem kept its color again during the Secret Wars. After the reappearance of the Gem, it was green, just like its MCU counterpart.\n\nAn unnamed Champion marks the first appearance of the Power Gem in the comics. The Champion was using the Power Gem to test his strength against the people of Tamarata without realizing its full potential. Thanos challenged the Champion and tricked him into destroying the planet by manipulating him to use the Gem’s power.\n\nThanos then offered to transport the Champion to a new planet in exchange for the Gem, which the Champion agreed to, unaware of the true value of the Gem. Like the other gems, Power Stone was destroyed during the Secret Wars storyline and consequently rebuilt by Reed Richards.\n\nWith the Power Stone, the user can access all energy and power that has ever existed or will exist and can amplify the abilities of the other gems. Its fundamental abilities include providing the user with unlimited stamina and strength, duplicating any physical superhuman power, and providing invincibility. Additionally, it can serve as an inexhaustible source of power for machines.\n\nRegarding the color, Power Stone was originally red. During the Secret Wars, it was yellow. After the rebuilding, The Power Gem turned purple like its MCU counterpart.\n\nDeath Stone is the newest Infinity Stone to be added to the rooster. Death Stone was created when Bor, Thor’s grandfather, ordered his mages to create the weapon of massive destruction so that he could crown himself the god-king of the realm. An explosion followed, and the combined might of magic and the weapon resulted in the creation of the Death Stone, a Gem that transformed a whole area of Niffleheim into an uninhabitable realm of death and decay.\n\nThe powers of the Death Stone are so far unclear, but the Gem is most likely connected to necromancy. Several powerful figures are on the search for the Gem, including Corvus Glaive, Dr. Doom, and Thor. The Death Stone allegedly holds the secret of Thanos’ return.\n\nIn terms of appearance, previous versions of the Death Stone in the Marvel comics were depicted as being golden in nature. The most recent version is supposed to be black. Death Stone is the only Infinity Gem that doesn’t share its origin story with the rest of the stones, and it shouldn’t be confused withthe non-canon “Ego Stone.”Nemsis’ suicide didn’t create Death Stone; therefore, it wasn’t destroyed and rebuilt during the Secret Wars.\n\nLatest news:\n\n© 2025 Comic Basics, a property ofIncomera d.o.o.",

    "title": "Hello - Wikipedia",
    "content": "\n\nHellois asalutationorgreetingin the English language. It is first attested in writing from 1826.[1]\n\nHello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of theNorwich CourierofNorwich, Connecticut.[1]Another early use was an 1833 American book calledThe Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee,[2]which was reprinted that same year inThe London Literary Gazette.[3]The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.[4]\n\nAccording to theOxford English Dictionary,hellois an alteration ofhallo,hollo,[1]which came fromOld High German\"halâ,holâ, emphatic imperative ofhalôn,holônto fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman\".[5]It also connects the development ofhelloto the influence of an earlier form,holla, whose origin is in the Frenchholà(roughly, 'whoa there!', from Frenchlà'there').[6]As in addition tohello,halloo,[7]hallo,hollo,hulloand (rarely)hilloalso exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.[8][9][10]\n\nBefore the telephone, verbal greetings often involved a time of day, such as \"good morning\". When the telephone began connecting people in different time zones, greetings without time gained popularity.[11]\n\nThomas Edisonis credited with popularizinghulloas a telephone greeting. In previous decades,hullohad been used as an exclamation of surprise (used early on byCharles Dickensin 1850)[12]andhalloowas shouted at ferry boat operators by people who wanted to catch a ride.[13]According to one account,halloowas the first word Edison yelled into his strip phonograph when he discovered recorded sound in 1877.[12]Shortly afterAlexander Graham Bellinvented the telephone, he answered calls by saying \"ahoyahoy\", borrowing the term used on ships.[13][14]There is no evidence the greeting caught on.[13]Edison suggestedHello!on August 15, 1877 in a letter to the president ofPittsburgh's Central District and Printing Telegraph Company, T. B. A. David:\n\nFriend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.\nWhat you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.[12]\n\nThe first name tags to includeHellomay have 1880 at Niagara Falls, which was the site of the first telephone operators convention. By 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as \"hello-girls\" because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.[14][15]\n\nA 1918 novel uses the spelling \"Halloa\" in the context of telephone conversations.[16]\n\nHellomight be derived from an older spelling variant,hullo, which the AmericanMerriam-Websterdictionary describes as a \"chiefly British variant of hello\",[17]and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting.Hullois found in publications as early as 1803.[18]The wordhullois still in use, with the meaninghello.[19][20][21][22]\n\nHellois alternatively thought to come from the wordhallo(1840) viahollo(alsoholla,holloa,halloo,halloa).[23]The definition ofhollois to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in ahuntwhen the quarry was spotted:[24][25]\n\nIf I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.\n\nFowler'shas it that \"hallo\" is first recorded \"as a shout to call attention\" in 1864.[26]It is used bySamuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poemThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerwritten in 1798:\n\nAnd the good south wind still blew behind,But no sweet bird did follow,Nor any day for food or play\n\nCame to the mariners' hollo!\n\nIn manyGermanic languages, including German,Danish,Norwegian,DutchandAfrikaans, \"hallo\" directly translates into English as \"hello\". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter fromWillem Bilderdijkto his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.[27]\n\nWebster's dictionaryfrom 1913 traces the etymology ofholloato the Old Englishhalowand suggests: \"Perhaps from ah + lo; compare Anglo Saxon ealā\".\n\nAccording to theAmerican Heritage Dictionary,hallois a modification of the obsoleteholla(stop!), perhaps from Old Frenchhola(ho, ho! +la, there, from Latinillac, that way).[28]\n\nStudents learning a new computerprogramming languagewill often begin by writing a \"Hello, World!\" program, which does nothing but issue the message \"Hello, World!\" to the user (such as by displaying it on a screen). It has been used since the earliest programs, and in many computer languages. This tradition was further popularised after being printed in an introductory chapter of the bookThe C Programming Languageby Kernighan & Ritchie.[29]The book had reused an example taken from a 1974 memo byBrian KernighanatBell Laboratories.[30]",

OnFebruary 21, 2557,[5]the vessel was officially commissioned after being refitted with technology that would add scientific and diplomatic endeavors to her capabilities.[19]ByFebruary 2558,Infinityhad a crew of 17,151 sailors,Marines, ONI operatives, and civilian personnel, as well as numerous adjunct members of the other UNSC branches and a number ofHuragokspecialists.[5][20]Infinitymay additionally embark an escort force of ten internally-dockedStrident-and laterAnlace-class frigates.[5][16][21]As ofOctober 2558, the primary shipboard AI isRoland.[22][23]The ship's motto isAudere Est Facere(To Dare is to Do).[4]\n\nIn2559, theInfinitywas presumed destroyed overInstallation 07during a largebattleover control of the ring,[24][25]although its current status is ultimately unknown.[26]\n\n\n\nAuthorised as an emergency mobile colony byProject OUROBOROS,[1]the ship was constructed in theSpecial Assembly Plant Concordlocated in theOort cloudsurrounding theSol system,[15]with construction beginning in2544.[4][27]The ship was designed by a team composed ofVice Admiral Elizabeth Sark,Commander Oscar Greyson, andDoctors Dana WolffandSada no Okuni.[1]Secrecy was ensured by having workers permanently stationed there over several years with a total communications blackout in effect. The ship's massive building expenditures, however, prevented ONI from keeping theInfinitya complete secret. Many senior members of the Admiralty, such asRear Admiral Saeed ShafiqofUNSC Procurement, were fully aware of the ship's existence at the time of her construction.[28]Eventually the Fleet took control of the vessel rather than theOffice of Naval Intelligence. Captain Andrew Del Rio took command of the ship and her pre-commission crew years prior to the end of major hostilities in the war,[15]thoughCINCONIMargaret Parangoskycorrectly predicted thatCommander Thomas Laskywould eventually supplant Del Rio.[29]\n\nAs ofMarch 2553, technology discovered onTrevelyan, ashield worldlocated in theZeta Doradus system, was planned to be incorporated into the ship.[28]Huragokassistance in refining the ship'sslipspacenavigation capabilities, in particular, was expected to push the final construction milestones far ahead of schedule.[30]Unlike older warships which had only areas such as a gym or hangar space forMarinesand Spartans to train in,Infinityis the first known vessel to include a state-of-the-art virtual reality combat deck capable of replicating environments from across the galaxy,[31]real or hypothetical, using a combination ofholography, props, and simulated sensory input fed through aneural interface.[32]\n\nA small number ofSpartan-IVsfrom the new program's first official class were assigned toInfinityin January 2553. Shortly afterward,Insurrectionistsled by the former Spartan-IVIlsa Zaneattempted a hostile takeover of the vessel, entering the ship disguised as a construction crew.[33]The attack was repelled, largely due to the efforts of SpartansSarah PalmerandEdward Davis. This incident exposedAdmiralMattius Drakeas the leader of theNew Colonial Alliance, and the Spartan-IVs' actions contributed to the establishment of the Spartans astheir own branch of service.[34]Additional Spartans were included in the ship's contingent as time progressed[15][31]and Palmer would later become the commanding officer of the ship's Spartan complement.[35]\n\n\n\nWith a number of further upgrades to the ship, theInfinitywas launched onMarch 22, 2553, with Del Rio at the helm.[37]In March,Infinityunderwent inspection byAdmiralsTerrence HoodandMargaret Parangosky. By this time many crew changes had been enacted on the ship.Dr. Catherine Halseywas put to work installing the ship'sForerunnerslipspace engines, under the supervision of Dr.Henry Glassman, the chief engineer. ManyHuragokfromTrevelyanhad been assigned to the ship, led byRequires Adjustment.Ainewas assigned to the ship as a temporary AI.[38]Parangosky met with Del Rio and Lasky, who discussed the current refit shape ofInfinity.[39]While aboard the ship, Parangosky and Hood received intel on the ongoingBlooding Years, learning thatVadam Keep, the headquarters ofArbiterThel 'Vadam, was about to be breached by theServants of the Abiding Truth. Hood contacted Vadam, who reluctantly agreed to accept Hood's help. After Glassman cleared the ship for combat, it departed for Sanghelios.[40]\n\nWhenInfinityarrived over Sanghelios,Kilo-Five'sprowlerUNSCPort Stanleydocked with the ship, and Parangosky gaveCaptainSerin Osmantwo Huragok, Requires Adjustment andLeaks Repaired, who made several refits to Kilo-Five's PelicanTart-Cart.[41]Soon, theSangheiliopposition shipDefender of Faithbegan to assault Vadam; the Elite vessel was easily destroyed.[42]The remaining Sangheili insurgent forces were all but destroyed whenInfinityfired her fore MAC gun on their positions, creating a massive crater on the Vadam coastline. Due toInfinity's help in the battle, Vadam was saved, and the battle trial was considered successful. Kilo-Five later rejoined the ship's crew.[43]\n\nThe UNSC officially commissionedInfinityinto service, publicly refocusing her mission on peace and exploration, on February 21, 2557. The following year, this date would be commemorated as \"InfinityDay\".[5]Infinitywas tasked with finding the rest of the Halo Array, and the UNSC forces managed to set up bases on Installation 03 as well as Installation 05 for studying and decommissioning the ringworlds.[44]Furthermore, theInfinitywas used to transport a massive Forerunner artifact known as theComposertoIvanoff Station, a research station in orbit of Installation 03. After an ONI team atIvanoff Stationvanished while researching the Composer, the ship's crew learned the location of theshield worldRequiem.[44]During the approach to Requiem,Infinitypicked up a distress call from theUNSCForward Unto Dawnand her two surviving crew,SpartanJohn-117and hissmart AIcompanionCortana. During the attempted rescue, the ship's control systems were hacked by theDidact, the leader of the Forerunners'PrometheanWarrior-Servants, which caused it to crash-land on the shield world's surface.[19]The Master Chief rallied scattered reconnaissance personnel and was soon reunited with Commander Lasky, whom he had met decades prior during theBattle of Circinius IV.[44]\n\nPromethean andCovenantforces boardedInfinitywhile the Didact scoured the ship's mainframe; though the ship's crew did not know at the time, he was searching for the location of the Composer. The Master Chief quickly broughtInfinity's point defenses back online, enabling her to destroy twoZanar-pattern light cruisersand to drive off the Didact'sCryptum. Shortly thereafter, Captain Del Rio ordered thatGypsy Companyneutralize a network ofparticle cannonsthat were suppressing UNSC aircraft in the area; this would allow an approach to the gravity well generator that was keepingInfinityinside the shield world, which in turn would allow the ship to return to Earth to report their findings.[45]\n\nAfter their return to the ship, John-117 and Cortana told Del Rio that they had encountered an imprint of theLibrarian; John insisted that the ship pursue the Didact before he could leave Requiem. Dismissing their claims as the result oframpancyand age, Del Rio ordered that Cortana be removed from service after she temporarily—and accidentally—disabled some of the ship's systems in a fit of rage. The Master Chief refused, and the bridge crew defied the captain's order to arrest the Spartan. Lasky then provided John aPelican gunship, requisitioning it under the pretense that it would be used to apprehend the Spartan. John jumped ship in the Pelican asInfinityescaped the shield world with Del Rio ordering a warning beacon dropped and a course set in forCarinae Station. Though John and Cortana were initially successful even withoutInfinity's help, a fit of rampancy caused Cortana to release the Didact's Cryptum from its impromptu containment structure. This allowed the Cryptum to interface with the Didact's ship,Mantle's Approach, after which the Didact set course for Installation 03 while John and Cortana pursued the Didact aboard a CovenantLich.[46]\n\nUponInfinity's return to Earth, Del Rio was relieved of command due to his abandonment of the Master Chief on Requiem. Lasky took over as commanding officer, just as Admiral Parangosky had planned.[47]In the meantime, the Didact acquired the Composer fromIvanoff Stationnear Installation 03 and integrated it intoMantle's Approach.[48]\n\nWhen the ship arrived in Earth's orbit,Infinitystood ready as the flagship ofBattlegroup Dakota, a detachment of theUNSC Home Fleet. SPARTAN-117 informed now-Captain Lasky that he intended to detonate aHAVOK tactical nuclear weaponinsideMantle's Approach, preventing the Composer from being fired against Earth. Once the ship's point-defense guns were neutralized,Infinityused two of her primary MACs to blast holes in the opposing vessel's hull. The Master Chief used one of these openings to enter the ship and eventually defeated the Didact, though not before the Composer digitized the residents ofNew Phoenix, Arizona,URNA. The ship was successfully destroyed, at the cost of Cortana's life.[47]A Pelican was dispatched to retrieve the Spartan, who then spoke with Captain Lasky before having his armor removed onSDeck for the first time in almost five years.[49]\n\nOnFebruary 7, 2558,Infinityreturned to Requiem to clear territory for UNSC research bases. The ship and hersub-vesselsquickly dispatched a small Covenant task force stationed at the entrance portal and deployed numerous dropships through the opening. A massive joint effort comprising the Navy,Army,Marine Corps,Air Force, andSpartansbegan securing areas on the surface from Covenant garrison forces.[16]After a short span of time, SpartanFireteam Crimsonsecureda Forerunner artifactfrom an area known as \"the Cauldron\" and brought it aboard the ship.[16]When the artifact began disruptingInfinity's power, artificial gravity, and propulsion, SpartanCommander Sarah Palmerwas able to disable it. Palmer, Captain Lasky, andChief Engineer Dr. Glassmanthen inspected the artifact. Palmer saved Lasky from being translocated along with Glassman to Requiem by the artifact.[50]Sometime later, Dr. Halsey was brought in to examine the artifact, much to Palmer's chagrin. Due to the artifact continuously causing problems for the ship, it then was navigated by Roland, who could accomplish little without human help.[51]\n\nSome time afterGabriel Thorne's disappearance through the translocation artifact, theInfinitywasinvadedby large numbers of Promethean Knights, followed by Covenant forces. The Covenant created havoc on board the ship, forcing theInfinityto recall all forces on Requiem to defend the ship. Fireteam Crimson was responsible for protecting the engine and server rooms, bringing the weapons systems back online, and even deactivated multiple nuclear warheads cloaked withactive camouflagestowed away on the ship, that had been earlier discovered as stolen.[52]It was later discovered that the primary goal of the boarding action was to kidnap Dr. Halsey forJul 'Mdama. Despite eliminating all boarders, theInfinityremained locked above Requiem due toa slipspace anchororiginating from the planet.[53]\n\nDr. Glassman deduced that the slipspace anchor was being generated by the Forerunner artifact aboard the ship and a pair of similar artifacts on Requiem. If the artifacts on the shield world were deactivated,Infinitywould be free. At the same time, Jul 'Mdama set Requiem to collide with its sun, with the anchor pulling theInfinityalong with it. Fireteams Majestic and Crimson were quickly dispatched to deactivate the artifacts, in which they succeeded. Once the two fireteams were aboard the ship,Lieutenant Jamesflew the ship away from Requiem on Captain Lasky's order.Infinitymade an emergency jump into slipspace as the shield world was consumed by the sun, immediately sending the star into a prematuresupernovastate. The ship emerged intact from the jump, with a number of reported injuries but no major casualties.[54]\n\nIn March 3, Fleet Admiral Terrence Hood pulled theInfinityaway from the pursuit of Jul 'Mdama and assigned the ship to escort Thel 'Vadam during negotiations onEalen IV, between 'Vadam and theJiralhanaeChieftainLydus.[55]CommanderBradleyhad taken Lasky's former place as executive officer by this time.[56]On March 5, during the negotiations,Covenant forcesled byShipmasterVata 'Gajatattacked the delegates.[55]The UNSC forces on the planet were unable to contact theInfinitybecause the Covenant were blocking the signal.[56]During the battle, Lasky and SpartanNaiya Raywere able to destroy the generator of the jamming signal and contactInfinity. As Lasky reestablished communications, Bradley informed him that the Sangheili and Jiralhanae ships were about to attack each other. However, Lasky was able to placate the crisis and the fleets eventually rallied withInfinity, forcing the Covenant fleet to retreat. The ambassadors successfully escaped the planet thanks to the sacrifices ofFireteam BaileyandPaul DeMarco, which were later commemorated in a memorial service held aboardInfinity.[57]\n\nDays later, a distress signal originating in theArtesia-702 systemwas picked up byInfinity. WhenInfinityarrived in the system on March 11, it found a damaged freighter, thePilgrims' Pride, and tugged it into one of its deployment bays. An ambush was sprung within the bay when the freighter set itself to self-destruct and multiple UNSC assault crafts exited its cargo bay. With the help of Fireteams Majestic,Colossus, andFenrir, the attack was repelled and the freighter was tugged back into space before it could self-destruct onInfinity. Following the skirmish,Infinity's after action teams discovered that the assault crafts from the freighter's attack were those belonging to the long-lostUNSCSpirit of Fire, a warship missing since February2531.[11]\n\nFollowing the lead onSpirit of Fire, Admiral Hood orderedInfinitytoOth Lodonin Jiralhanae space. Instead of the ship,Infinity's crew discovered aCovenant space stationoperated byNew Colonial Allianceinsurgents led by CaptainDaniel Clayton, the illegitimate son of theSpirit's captain,James Cutter.[58]Infinitysustained tremendous damage from three discharges of the station'sglassingweapon, including starboard-to-port hull breaches and fires on the bridge; Commander Bradley was killed and Hood was paralyzed from the waist down. However, Commander Palmer and Fireteam Majestic boarded and captured the station before another blast could be fired, instead turning the weapon on Vata 'Gajat'scorvettethat was about to destroyInfinity.[59]After the battle, theInfinitywas put under repairs and most of its staff was transferred to other duties. In mid-April 2558, over a month after the events at Oth Lodon, the ship was fully repaired.[60]\n\nInMay 2558,Infinitywas involved in an ONI-commissioned mission to capturea Sangheiliwielding a newbioweaponon the unclaimed planetVen III. Captain Lasky deployed a team of two Spartans,Gabriel ThorneandNaiya Ray, on the planet via aprowlerstored aboardInfinity. AfterInfinitylost communications with the Spartans and a UNSCspy droneon Ven III, Roland proposed thatInfinityhead toward the planet. Lasky was at first hesitant to involve the ship as he had been ordered to avoid direct engagement, but after Spartan Ray discovered an enormousKig-Yarpirateoperation shortly before being ambushed, he ordered Roland to set course for Ven III and call all Spartan teams on deck.[61]\n\nUpon arriving at Ven III,Infinitywas met by the pirates' advance fleet. The ship deployed several Broadswords to counter the fleet as well as a rescue convoy to retrieve the two Spartans on the surface.Infinitysuccessfully repelled the fleet in space whileLongswordstook out the remaining fleet on the planet as well as the pirates' base. On the surface Ray was about to retrieve the bioweapon from the Sangheili agent butONIagents arrived in order to retrieve the weapon themselves as well as detain the Elite agent. Thorne and Ray were successfully returned to theInfinitywhile Lasky and Palmer discussed ONI's intervention at the conclusion of the mission.[62]\n\nFollowing the bioweapon incidentInfinitywas deployed to assist in attack against the human colonyOban. Following the battleInfinitymade a slipspace jump towardsGalileo IIbase. However, the ship suddenly reappeared in anasteroidbelt, colliding with an asteroid and causing some damage inside the ship.Infinityjumped to slipspace again, only to reappear a quarter of a kilometer of her last position. Roland told Captain Lasky that it is was inadvisable to make another jump. Dr. Glassman discoveredInfinity's slipspace drive was overriding any coordinate except the one of the location in which they were sticking the ship in a \"Slipspace cul-de-sac\". In that moment, Roland found an unusual energy reading coming from the equator of an uncharted planet —Aktis IV— near their position. Glassman and Lasky supposed that the location was the source of the problem and Palmer ordered to gather a team and send them with Dr. Glassman to the planet. Unknown to the crew, the ship had been stranded by Dr. Halsey who used aForerunner artifactto contactInfinity's Forerunner components, including her slipspace drive, and trapped them in the system.[63]\n\nLocating the source of interference to an island on the planet, Palmer, Fireteam Majestic, and Glassman soon discovered a Forerunner artifact in a Forerunner structure. Aktis IV has an ocean consisting of an unidentified substance that was impenetrable toInfinity's sensors. After Glassman discovered that the artifact was seemingly compatible with the Janus Key, the UNSC's half of the Key was sent to the island fromInfinityfor further analysis. However, the UNSC aircraft carrying the key were shot down bySali 'Nyonand hissplinter group. In the confusion, 'Mdama's fleet, which had avoided detection by hiding in the planet's oceans, rose up and began deploying troops. As the UNSC forces on the planet retreated into the Forerunner structure,Infinitydeployed reinforcements.[12]As 'Mdama's fleet engagedInfinityin the planet's atmosphere, the vessel could not establish contact with the UNSC forces inside the Forerunner structure. Later,Infinitysucceeded in deployed at least twoMantisesto the planet's surface to battle the Covenant forces.[64]Infinityand itsStrident-class sub-vessels continued to engage 'Mdama's fleet until the battle eventually drew to a close with Jul's acquisition of both halves of the Janus Key. After picking up the UNSC forces on the surface,Infinityleft Aktis IV. Three days later, on July 23, ONI agents arrived onboard in order to interrogate Commander Palmer for her failure to secure the Janus Key and Dr. Halsey.[65]\n\nBy late 2558,Infinityhad received a full systems upgrade as well as scheduled maintenance. By this time, construction on a secondInfinity-class vessel, theUNSCEternityhad commenced. To save resources, several modules were borrowed from the incompleteEternityto supplant those on theInfinity, leading to the replacement of several non-essential weapon systems.[1]\n\nIn October 2558, UNSCInfinityserved as mission control for bothFireteam OsirisandBlue Team. After a successful assassination ofJul 'Mdamaduring theBattle of Kamchatka, Fireteam Osiris returned Dr. Halsey to UNSC custody aboard the Infinity.[66]Shortly afterward, Spartan Blue Team, led by the Master Chief, were sent fromInfinityto reclaim the lost ONI research vesselArgent Moon, but went AWOL after receiving a cryptic message fromCortanaand denyingInfinity's orders to ignore her calling toMeridian.[67]With the UNSC's most veteran Spartans having deserted, Fireteam Osiris was deployed to arrest them.[68]Osiris returned the following day, though, without Blue Team but with an account of aGuardianawakening on Meridian's surface and Blue Team having escaped on it. Having been tracking previous and current Guardian attacks,Infinitymade it their priority to track down the Master Chief by activating an inert Guardian hidden inSanghelios.[69]\n\nWith the aid ofthe Arbiterand theSwords of Sanghelios,Infinity's forces were able to activate the Guardian and deliver Osiris aboard it.[70]Their achievement and subsequent defeat of Jul 'Mdama's remnant forces came to naught, however, as Osiris followed the Guardians to the planetGenesisand discovered the constructs were part of a plan byCortanato put the galaxyunder the control of AIs. Both Master Chief and Osiris were unable to stop Cortana, and so her Guardians were released to shut down all weapons and technology across the colonies. When a Guardian was sent to pacify Sanghelios,Infinitywas still in the star system but a good ways off and fled toEarthafter witnessing what was happening.[71]However, when Cortana began theSubjugation of Earth,Infinitywas forced to make an emergency slipspace jump to avoid being taken down by the Guardians' EMP blast. With no option left to them but to run, Captain Lasky promised theInfinitywould return when the Created could be fought.[22]The UNSCInfinitywas one of the few vessels that managed to escape the Guardians.[72]At least a day after the Created began to subjugate Earth,Infinityanswered a distress call by theUNSCSentry of El Morrowhich was under attack by theWarden Eternal.[73]\n\nWhen Fireteam Osiris and Blue Team returned to Sanghelios, they learned that Halsey, using the Forerunner technology in the area, had managed to make contact with Roland, who remained loyal to humanity, aboard theInfinity. Due to needing Halsey's help to stop the Created threat, Lasky set up a rendezvous on the far side ofSubanat eighteen hundred standard time the next day whereInfinitywould remain for fifteen minutes. Usingthe Pelicanthe Spartans had escaped fromGenesison, they were able to reachInfinitywhichCaptainVeronica Darehad also joined up with.[71]Shortly after returning to the ship,Edward Buckwas sent on a classified mission with Dare to reuniteAlpha-Ninein order to contact theUnited Rebel FrontonCassidy IIIin hopes of gaining information on the Forerunner cloaking technology protecting their colony. Lasky set up a predetermined series of locations and times whereInfinitycould be found for brief periods, allowing Alpha-Nine to return to the ship after the mission. Later, while relaxing in the Full Moon bar onInfinitywith Fireteam Osiris and Alpha-Nine, Buck and Dare were married by Roland who stated that as the ship's AI, he had the same authority to perform weddings that the captain of a ship did.[74]\n\nIn October 2559, it deployed a portion of its Spartan and Marine complement intoNew Mohácsto help theViery Militiain warding off the Banished assault.[75][76]It soon jumped into slipspace following the completion of Operation WOLFE because it detected a Tau surge indicating the arrival of a Guardian.[77]\n\nIn late 2559,Infinitywas part of a UNSC fleet that was sent toInstallation 07on a mission to eliminate Cortana usingThe Weapon.Infinityarrived at Zeta Halo on December 12 and immediately fell intoan ambush, with theInfinitysustaining multiple hull breaches from the initial attack.[78]The Banished had arrived at the ring earlier, and begun fortifying the ring's surface to neutralize Cortana.[79]Four approachingBanished dreadnoughtsattacked the supercarrier and overwhelmed its defenses.[80]Multiple Banished raiding parties, including one personally led byAtriox, stormed the ship.[78][81]With the boarders making rapid progress, John-117 took charge of escorting Captain Lasky from the bridge to the hangar bay for evacuation, and was aided along the way byFireteam Taurus.[82][83][84]Although the hangar was being overrun by Banished by the time Lasky's group reached it, an intact dropship was secured, and as Lasky departed for the surface of Zeta Halo he declaredInfinityhad been compromised and issued the order for all remaining crew to abandon ship.[85][86][87]\n\nFollowing the evacuation order,Infinitywas rammed amidships by aBanished dreadnoughtand sustained severe damage. Shortly afterward, John-117, who had stayed aboard and continued fighting in the hangar, was confronted by Atriox and flung out into space; both he and the Banished leader were presumed killed in action since contact with them was lost. Meanwhile, aconflictbetween UNSC survivors and the Banished for control of Zeta Halo unfolded on the ring's surface.[88]\n\nInfinitywent missing following the battle, and while its status is unknown,[26]the surviving UNSC personnel believed it to be destroyed.[89]Escharumlater claimed that the flagship of the UNSC had been neutralized in only four minutes.[25]\n\nFrom stem to stern,Infinityhas a length of 5,694.2 meters (18,681.6 feet), a beam of 833.3 meters (2,733.9 feet), and a height of 1,041.2 meters (3,415.9 feet). This makes her the largest warship the UNSC Navy has ever commissioned, surpassing previous record holders such as thePunic-class supercarrier.[31][90]and among the largest starships built by humanity ever.  Among contemporary vessels her length is surpassed only by the Covenant's 29-kilometerSh'wada-pattern supercarriers[91]and the Sangheili's 6.3-kilometerLursu-pattern brigantines, though by Forerunner standards she qualifies as a mere destroyer.[92]For transportation throughout the enormous vessel,Infinityis equipped with a high-speedtramsystem.[51]\n\nHer hull is covered in 4.9 meters oftitanium-A3 armor. The ship also one of the first UNSC vessels to possessenergy shields, a byproduct of extensive reverse engineering of Covenant shielding and improvements in human development. The combination of armor and shields is strong enough to withstand direct impact with a CovenantMaugen-pattern armored cruiserwhile sustaining negligible damage.[16]The ship's sublight power plant is aXR2 Boglin Fields: S81/X-DFR, afusion-powered set of one primary and two secondaryrepulsor engines.[4]This entire city-sized engine module took fifteen years to design, build and test.[1]Translightpower is provided by aMark X Macedon/Z-PROTOTYPE #78720HDSmounted on a remote carriage.[2]The latter is of Forerunner design and origin, capable of dropping out of slipspace with pinpoint accuracy.[51]It is also capable of powering itself by drawing upon foamingvacuum energy, which powers it independently of the ship's powerplants. As the alien slipspace drive is not compatible with UNSC standard power and data feeds, a series of Engine Module Interlinks - interlocks based on Covenant control restrictors - are fitted.[1]TheInfinityis also waterproof.[93]\n\nIn late 2558, theInfinityunderwent a major refit that included the replacement of several non-essential systems along with major works to the hull.[1]\n\n\n\nAs of February 2558,Infinityhad an official complement of 17,151. This included 8,900 Navy personnel, 5,400Marines, 750ODSTs, 1,700ONIagents, 480 civilianUEGpersonnel, 8Huragok, and 24Swords of Sangheliosmembers. These are organised into a Marine Expeditionary Division and a drop battalion for the ODSTs, which are then subdivided into five task forces, each of which can operate independently.[1]She also houses hundreds ofSpartan-IVsled byCommander Sarah Palmer; the ship's S-deck, affectionately known as \"Spartan Town\", is dedicated to their use and features a number ofBrokkr Armor Mechanismsfor mounting and dismounting armour. Additionally, 800 ofArmyand 200Air Forceassets were assigned to the ship during hersecond tour on Requiem.[16][Note 2]TheInfinityis almost completely self-sufficient, boasting facilities and comforts normally only seen on colony support ships.[1]\n\nMass deployment is realized through a large number of bays located throughout the vessel.Infinityhas 275 Cat-1 primary bays, 140 Cat-2 secondary bays, 108 Cat-3 matériel deployment bays, and ten Cat-8 sub-vessel deployment bays: the last of these each carries aStrident-class heavy frigateor anAnlace-class light frigate. Single deployment is afforded by 329R1295 Launching System/M9407 SOEIVsand 124 B854 Jettison Bays/M8823 HEVs. Emergency escape vehicles include 8,900SKT-29 Class-8 Enclosed Heavy Lifeboats/Controlledand 12,750RLT-85 Emergency Shuttlepods.[5]\n\nInfinityis also equipped with sizable recreational areas, including a large atrium-like memorial park. Located under an enormous transparent dome,[94]the park has a self-contained biosphere complete with plants and animal life and has been said to surpass many natural parks onEarthin size.[95]Garden plots and activity centres are also found here, with the ceiling being host to an artificial skydome.[1]Among other crew amenities, the ship contains a bar known as theFull Moon.[74]For training purposes, severalWar Gamestraining arenas can be aboard. Among them includes the second-largest military simulation and test environment in the human sphere. The Science Deck of theInfinityis home to state-of-the-art laboratories and research facilities, provided by ONI and theWatershed Division.[1]\n\nIt is unclear whetherInfinityhas a permanent escort formation apart from her internally docked sub-vessels, though on occasion she has been accompanied formations comprising as many as dozens of vessels. An escort fleet consisting of roughly two dozenParis-class heavy frigatesand a dozenAutumn-class heavy cruisersaccompaniedInfinityon her first mission to Requiem, though only two of the frigates are known to have arrived along with their parent ship;[96]they may have been destroyed when the shield world's artificial gravity well was activated.[19]ElevenAutumn-class cruisers (includingUNSCSong of the East)[97]accompaniedInfinityat some point between her return to Earth (ca.July 2557) and return to Requiem (February 2558).[98]At least threeVindication-class light battleshipswere dispatched to the planet along withInfinityduring the UNSC's second expedition there.[99]\n\nInfinityis equipped with a highly-advanced sensor andholographicimaging suite derived from Forerunner technology discovered onTrevelyan.[100]The system uses a combination of various shipboard sensors and imaging from orbital drones to produce a hyper-accurate real-time image of a planetary surface in the ship'sholotanks, such as thebridge's main holotable.[101]Infinityalso features 16 channel slipspace wavecom datalinks forsuperluminal communications.[4]Infinity's aft sensor array is equipped with a long-rangehyperscannerand a ForerunnerLuminary.[1]\n\nInfinity's primary armament is four 27 meter boreCR-03, Series-8 magnetic accelerator cannonscapable of firing various sub-caliber rounds, cargo packages, and autonomous kill vehicles with specialized payloads.[4]Infinityboasts a significant missile network that can be implemented for ship-to-ship combat, and anti-air defense, orbital gunfire support for Marine forces, among other uses. Emplaced throughout the ship are 1,100 missile pods of three types:Archer,Rapier, andHowler. TheM42 Archer missileprovides secondary armament forInfinitywith 350 pods of 24 missiles each. Additional missiles include theM75 Rapier(250x30 missiles) and theM96 Howler(500x20 missiles).

    "content": "\n\nHalo Infiniteis a 2021first-person shootergamedeveloped by343 Industriesand published byXbox Game Studios. It is the sixth mainline installment in theHaloseries,[1]followingHalo 5: Guardians(2015). The game's campaign follows the humansupersoldierMaster Chiefand his fight against a mercenary organization, known asthe Banished, on the Forerunner ringworld Zeta Halo. Unlike previous mainline entries in the series, the multiplayer portion of the game isfree-to-play.\n\nInfinitewas intended to release as a launch title for theXbox Series X/S, but was delayed in August 2020 after its gameplay reveal in July 2020 drew negative feedback from both critics andHalofans.[2][3]Following anopen betarelease of the multiplayer component on November 15, 2021, coinciding with the franchise's 20th anniversary, the campaign was released on December 8, 2021, forWindows,Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.\n\nHalo Infinitereceived generally favorable reviews from critics, with some deeming the game a return to form for the series. Praise was directed towards its visuals, gameplay, open world design, soundtrack, and story.\n\nHalo Infiniteis afirst-person shooter. In the game's story mode, players assume the role ofplayer characterMaster Chief, as he wages a war against the Banished, an alien faction.[4]Players traverse theopen worldZeta Halo, fighting the Banished with a mixture of vehicles and weapons. Players also have access to special equipment, such as the Grappleshot, which pulls Chief towards foes, retrieves items, or help to traverse the terrain.[5]\n\nThecampaign mode's semi-open worldstructure allows players to freely explore parts of the ring-world Zeta Halo setting, which are segmented off from each other and initially impassable. Scattered across the environment areForward Operating Bases(FOBs), which can be captured once cleared of enemies. Captured bases serve as fast-travel points.[5][6]Other points of interest found across Zeta Halo's surface include \"high-value targets\" to eliminate, Marine squads to rescue, and Banished propaganda towers to destroy.[7]Completing these side objectives earns the player Valor, which is used to earn weapons and vehicles that players can call in from FOBs.[5][6]The more linear environments within the ring's surface hew more to traditionalHalomission design. These missions serve to advance the story, and can be replayed once completed via the in-game TACMAP.[8]Collectibles found in the environment, such as audio logs, provide additional story details.[9]\n\nInfinite's multiplayer component featuresdeathmatch,capture the flag, and other modes played in standard 4-versus-4 and Big Team Battle variants; the latter bumps the player count in matches up to 24.[10]Ability pickups allow players to activate special powers a limited number of times. Powers include dashing, active camouflage, and \"repulsor\" charges that can knock enemies, projectiles, and vehicles back.[11]A training mode allows players to test weapons in weapon drills, or play against computer-controlled bot players in practice matches.[12]\n\nHalo Infiniteis set in the year 2560. During the events ofHalo 5: Guardians, the human artificial intelligenceCortanaand allied artificial intelligences (AIs) rebel against their creators, the United Nations Space Command (UNSC). Taking control of ancient Forerunner weapons known as Guardians, Cortana subjugates the galaxy. Also fighting against Cortana and the UNSC are theBanished, a mercenary organization composed of aliens and humans led by the BruteAtriox.[13]The game is set on the Forerunner ringworld Installation 07 (Zeta Halo), which has mysteriously suffered damage. The player character, Master Chief Petty OfficerJohn-117is a UNSC \"Spartan\" supersoldier on a mission to neutralize Cortana, his former partner.[14]\n\nIn addition to the narrative told in the campaign,Halo Infinite's multiplayer component features a seasonal story that centers on Spartan Commander Laurette Agryna's efforts to lead a new generation of Spartan supersoldiers in the aftermath of Cortana's attacks on various UNSC military strongholds.[15]\n\nIn December 2559, the UNSC shipInfinityarrives at Halo Installation 07. Upon arrival, the ship is ambushed by several dreadnoughts that are operated by the Banished. While defending the ship's hangar bay from multiple raiding parties, the Master Chief is caught off-guard by Atriox, the leader of the Banished, and is subsequently defeated in a one-on-one duel. Atriox throws the Chief from the edge of the hangar bay, leaving him stranded in space.\n\nSix months later, a UNSC pilot recovers the Chief adrift in space. While the Pilot wants to flee, Master Chief insists on continuing the fight against the Banished. The Chief and Pilot travel to Zeta Halo, which has been severely damaged by an unknown calamity. On the ring, Master Chief locates the Weapon, an AI designed to imitate Cortana in order to capture her for deletion. While the Weapon states that she was successful in her mission, she has failed to self-delete as per her directives. Master Chief retrieves the Weapon, and experiences visions of Cortana's memories and thoughts left as residual data.\n\nZeta Halo is controlled by the Banished, now led by Atriox's lieutenant Escharum after Atriox's apparent death. The dying Brute is invigorated to have Master Chief as his final opponent. Master Chief, the Weapon, and a reluctant Pilot rally scattered UNSC forces on the ring's surface, while looking for any Spartans that haven't been picked off by The Hand of Atriox, Escharum’s team of Spartan killers. Inside the Forerunner installation known as the Conservatory, Master Chief encounters Despondent Pyre, the AI caretaker of Zeta Halo. Despondent Pyre attempts to warn Master Chief of a threat contained on the installation, but is destroyed by the Harbinger, an alien awoken by the Banished. The Harbinger claims that her people, the Endless, were imprisoned by the Forerunners on Zeta Halo. She has allied herself with the Banished in order to rebuild the Silent Auditorium, a facility that will allow her to free her people. The Banished, in turn, will use the repaired Halo as a weapon against humanity.\n\nMaster Chief defends the pilot from a duo of Spartan killers deployed by Escharum. The Pilot reveals that he was a civilian engineer aboardInfinitywho stole a Pelican to flee the battle. The Chief comforts him, admitting his own guilt over his failure to save Cortana. Master Chief and the Weapon stop Zeta Halo's repair process by disabling a series of spires on the ring, but are unable to stop a section of the Auditorium from being rebuilt. When the Harbinger attempts to hack the Weapon, the Chief activates a failsafe to delete the AI. The Weapon repels the Harbinger and deactivates the failsafe, angrily asking why Master Chief does not trust her. After seeing a vision in which Cortana uses the Guardians to destroy the Brutes' home planet of Doisac, the Weapon realizes that she is a copy of Cortana, and insists that Master Chief delete her so she does not become like her predecessor; Master Chief refuses, stating that he wants to trust her. The Pilot is captured by Jega 'Rdomnai, an Elite Spartan killer and a close friend of Escharum, as bait for Master Chief. Unwilling to let the Pilot die, Master Chief infiltrates the Banished facility and saves him, defeating Jega 'Rdomnai and Escharum in the process.\n\nMaster Chief and the Weapon rush to the Auditorium to stop the Harbinger. The two learn that Cortana was captured by Atriox after the Weapon locked her down; upon realizing that Atriox intended to access the ring's secrets, Cortana destroyed herself, damaged Zeta Halo, and prevented the Weapon from being deleted. In a recorded message, Cortana says goodbye to the Chief and encourages him to work with the Weapon. The Chief defeats the Harbinger, but is unable to stop her from contacting someone regarding the Endless. Afterwards, the Weapon and Chief reunite with the Pilot, who reveals his name is Fernando Esparza. The Weapon decides to choose a name for herself.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the surviving Atriox uses a key to unlock a sealed door, leading to the Endless. If the game is finished on Legendary difficulty, the scene features dialogue between Despondent Pyre and a Forerunner official about the imprisonment of the Endless. When Despondent Pyre states that she cannot oversee the study of the Endless alone, the Forerunner replies that the AI Offensive Bias has been deployed to assist her.\n\nIn late 2552, during theCovenant's assault on Earth,[b]a young woman named Laurette Agryna sneaks around the streets ofLondon, attempting to evade Covenant patrols. She is spotted by a pack of Brutes, but is saved by a group of Spartans. Agryna later joins the UNSC military and eventually goes on to join the Spartan-IV program. Seven years after the fall of the Covenant,[c]in the wake of Cortana's attack on Laconia Station and the disappearance of both the Master Chief and the UNSCInfinity,[d]Agryna—now serving as a Spartan Commander—begins training a new generation of Spartans and establishes new training facilities on classified frontier worlds, such as theAvery J. Johnson Academy of Military Science.\n\nMeanwhile, during a reconnaissance operation to a former UNSC shipyard on the planet Camber, Spartans Sigrid Eklund and Hieu Dinh discover that the Banished have created their own AI construct, named Iratus. The construct detects Eklund and Dinh's presence in the yard and alerts the Banished, forcing the duo to hijack a Banished Phantom in order to escape. Iratus, however, follows them and attempts to lock down the Phantom's flight controls. In order to regain access to the flight controls, Dinh allows Iratus to infect his neural interface, leaving him unconscious. After returning to the Academy, Eklund informs Agryna of their encounter with Iratus. While Agryna devises a plan to pull the AI construct out of Dinh's neural interface, Iratus attempts to break Dinh by forcing him to relive his memories ofOperation: Interior Exile—a botched UNSC attempt to secure Forerunner artifacts that resulted in numerous deaths. Agryna's plan eventually succeeds and Iratus, along with a complete archive of the Banished's operations on Camber, is secured, saving Dinh's life in the process.\n\nAfter the capture of Iratus, Agryna begins to prepare her Spartan recruits for a larger conflict with the Banished. While practicing at the Academy's firing range, Eklund expresses concern over Dinh's state of mind after the incident on Camber, but Dinh assures her that she and Agryna have nothing to worry about. Some time later, Dinh—alongside an unnamed Spartan recruit,[e]discovers an entry point to a secret underground base, built by the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) at the beginning of humanity's war against the Covenant. Dinh reveals to the Spartan recruit that he received his first set of UNSC armor at the base, before realizing that Iratus may have been attempting to learn the location of the ONI base from him. Moments later, Iratus hijacks the base's power systems; he declares that the base's secrets now belong to the Banished and takes control of a set ofSPIarmor.\n\nDeveloper343 IndustriesproducedHalo 4(2012) andHalo 5: Guardians(2015) as part of the \"Reclaimer Saga\", a series of games initially planned as a trilogy.[16][17][18]Halo Infinitewas developed by 343 Industries with assistance fromSkyBox Labs, Sperasoft,The Coalition,Certain Affinityand Atomhawk.[19][20][21][22][23]\n\nThe studio played with the idea of makingHaloan open world game, drawing inspiration from other video games such asThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, with the idea of allowing to explore a large open area, with the freedom of completing the game in any order.[24]\n\nWhile reception toHalo 5was overall positive, the campaign received criticism for not including enough of Master Chief; 343 Industries promised to refocus on the character going forward.[25][26]\n\nIt utilizes the new Slipspace Engine.[27][28][29]The game was written by Paul Crocker, who was also associate creative director of the campaign.[30][31]Justin Dinges and Nicolas Bouvier were chosen as artists.[30][32]The multiplayer component of the game was directed by Tom French, Associate Creative Director of multiplayer, and Pierre Hintze, Project Lead and Partner Head of multiplayer.[33][34]The tools used for the Slipspace Engine used basic development tools called Faber. Some parts of Faber dated back to the early 2000s, having also been used forBungie'sHalogames. As a result, its coding became notoriously difficult to use by 343 Industries, being consideredtechnical debt. 343 Industries had also excessively relied on hiring contract workers to the point of making up half the studio according to estimates. Due to Microsoft's policy that limits contract workers to keep their jobs for up to 18 months, the number of workers at 343 Industries gradually fell.[24]\n\nHalo Infinitewas beset by further issues during development. The game suffered from creative instability for some time; the studio was described to be split into \"fiefdoms\", and that the struggle to complete the game and the conflicting decisions resulted in \"four or five games being developed simultaneously.\"[24]Two-thirds of the planned game was cut by summer 2019, which severely removed some of the initial vision. Despite this, the planned deadline of November 2020 to be a launch game for the Xbox Series X/S was decided to be impossible to meet.[24]Development director Frank O'Connor stated in August 2019 thatHalo Infinitewas being built \"so it plays and looks fantastic\" on Xbox One, but would have enhancements when played on Xbox Series X/S.[35]\n\nThe gameplay reveal on July 23, 2020, saw criticism from the gaming community for the game's visual quality, which saw further changes to development.[24]On August 27, 2020, 343 Industries announced thatJoseph Staten, the former lead writer and cinematic director of theHaloseries at Bungie, had joined as Campaign Project Lead forHalo Infinite.[36]343 Industries later announced that Staten's role had changed to Head of Creative forHalo Infinite.[37]Staten had convinced Microsoft to delay the game to 2021 in order to release a stable launch. He had provided a list of reasons why the game would be better if the deadline was pushed. When the game was delayed, features were added and improved, including the graphics.[38]On October 28, 2020, Bloomberg News reported that (now former) Studio Head Chris Lee had departed the project.[39]\n\nHalo Infinitewas intended to have split-screen campaign co-op in response to the backlash of its removal inHalo 5: Guardians,[40]but the feature was delayed several times and was ultimately cancelled by September 2022.[41]The game supports bothcross-platform playand cross-platform save progression between Xbox and Windows versions.[42]Campaign network co-op was eventually included as part of the Winter Update in November 2022 along with several other features, including the ability to replay old missions via the in-game TACMAP, which was absent from the game's release.[8][43]\n\nThe music forHalo Infiniteis a collaboration betweenGareth Coker,[44]Curtis Schweitzer,[45]Joel Corelitz,[46]Alex Bhore,[47]and Eternal Time & Space, overseen by 343 Industries Music Supervisor Joel Yarger.[48]Infinite's soundtrack was released digitally on December 8, 2021, in two albums, one covering the score for the campaign,[49]and another covering the music for the game's multiplayer component.[50]An additional soundtrack album, featuring music written forInfinite's post-launch seasons, was released on February 23, 2024.[51]\n\nHalo Infinitewas announced in a trailer atE3 2018with its release confirmed, at the time, for Xbox One and Windows.[52][53][54][55]The developer said that all of the scenes in the trailer were running in-engine.[56][57][58]During E3 2018 it was confirmed thatInfinitewas planned to have a beta prior to its release, described as an insider flight program.[32]\n\nAtE3 2019the following year,Halo Infinitewas confirmed that it would be a launch game for the next-generation Xbox consoles.[59][60]In January 2020, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty confirmed that the studio had no immediate plans for Xbox Series X exclusives at launch, preferring to phase out compatibility with older hardware over a longer period, similar toPCs.[61]TheCOVID-19 pandemicforced developers toremote work.[62]After the Xbox Games Showcase on July 23, 2020, 343 Studio Head Chris Lee stated that a public beta was unlikely due to the impact of the ongoing pandemic,[63][64]despite Microsoft stating at E3 2018 that there would be a public beta ahead of launch.[65]343 Industries said that the game would receive a freeray tracingupdate post-launch.[66]On July 31, 2020, it was announced that the game's multiplayer portion would be released as afree-to-playgame.[67]\n\nOn August 11, 2020, it was announced that the game had been delayed to an undefined date in 2021,[68][69][70]due to a range of factors impacting development, including the COVID-19 pandemic.[71]Microsoft initially planned to split the game into several parts but ultimately decided against it. It was reported that 343 Industries was heavily outsourcing the game to external developers, resulting in development troubles, and was a contributing factor to the delay.[72]Speaking toIGN, a spokesperson for 343 Industries denied that theHalo TV showwas having an impact onHalo Infinite'sdevelopment, butIGNstated that \"the spokesperson did not speak to the report's claim that 'a significant portion of the game is being outsourced to third-party contractors.'\"[73]\n\nIn December 2020, 343 Industries announcedHalo Infinitewould be released in late 2021,[74][75][76]later giving a December 8, 2021, release date.[77]\n\nA technical test for the multiplayer portion of the game ran from July 29 – August 2, 2021, where select members of the Halo Insider Program could compete in teams across three maps against bots in 4v4 Slayer mode.[78]On August 20, 2021, it was announced that the game would be launching without campaign co-op, a longtime feature of the series. It was also announced thatForge, a creative environment where players could design their own maps and gametypes, would not be available at launch.[79]On August 25, 2021,Infinitewas announced to be releasing on December 8, 2021.[80]Additional testing \"flights\" ran September 23–26 and September 30 – October 3, with the first round centered around 4v4player-versus-playermultiplayer,[81]and the second introducing 12v12 Big Team Battle on the larger map Fragmentation.[82]343 used player feedback during the flights to make changes to the game before release.[83]\n\nOn October 25, 2021, 343 Industries published a video depicting the game's campaign mode for the first time since its initial panned debut in July 2020; the footage offers a first look into several previously untold aspects of the mode's gameplay and plot.[5]\n\nOn November 15, 2021, anopen betaofHalo Infinite's multiplayer aspect was released on Windows, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in celebration of theXboxand theHaloseries' 20th anniversary.[84]The game wasreleased to manufacturingon November 19, 2021.[85]Halo Infinitereleased on December 8, 2021.\n\nAs the industry expositionE3 2020was canceled due to theCOVID-19 pandemic,[86]Microsoft revealed the first gameplay footage ofHalo Infinitevia livestream. On June 24, 2020, the officialHaloYouTubechannel premiered a teaser titled \"SIGNAL DETECTED. TAG DESIGNATION: FOE\",[87]which featured an audio clip of an anonymous character who representsthe Banished, a faction introduced inHalo Wars 2.[88]\n\nAmong the merchandising tie-ins for the game wasMonster Energy Drink, a \"Moa burger\"-flavored version ofPringles, andDr. Squatch\"Spartan Soap\". Participants can earn a variety of in-game weapon skins, player nameplates and weapon emblems. There are also several augmented reality experiences throughSnapchatas part of the promotion.[89][90][91]\n\nCoinciding withInfinite's gameplay reveal was a trailer, \"Step Inside\", produced by 215 McCann, who had previously worked on the\"Believe\" campaign forHalo 3. The spot, showing Master Chief's armor being made, was the kickoff to a wider campaign, \"Become\", which focused on how the events of the games are shaped by ordinary people in theHalouniverse.[92][93]\n\nAtE3 2021, Microsoft unveiled two new trailers for the game, one showcasing the multiplayer campaign and the other a general story trailer.[94][95]\n\nOn August 25, 2021, a CGI trailer for the first season ofInfinite'smultiplayer mode was released, focusing on the backstory of the new character Commander Agryna in an occupiedLondon.[15]\n\nMicrosoft created anInfinite-themed console andElite Wireless Controllerto tie in with the game's release. Other tie-in hardware included hard drives, keyboards, mice, and a limited number ofHalo-themedRadeon RX 6900graphics processing units.[96][97]\n\nFollowing the campaign gameplay reveal forHalo Infiniteon July 23, 2020, publications and audiences expressed disappointment over the graphics and performance.[2]Eurogamerwrote that \"Halo Infinitelooks like the fake plastic trees version ofHalo, like a video game designed with Mega Bloks in mind. It pops in all the wrong places. [...] It doesn't feel grounded. It doesn't feel like it has depth. It feels, well, surface level, smooth and uninteresting.\"[3]Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox marketing, responded in an interview withInside Gaming:\"Listen, we're in the middle of a global pandemic. It's July, we're far from [launch in] Holiday, you're seeing a work-in-progress game.\" He said that the final game would be a \"visual showcase\".[98][99]Narrative experience director Dan Chosich tweeted: \"I want you to know your voice matters + is heard [...] I always want to live up to the legacy that Bungie pioneered. I personally care a lot about honoring that.\"[100]\n\nA screenshot of the gameplay showing an attacking Brute with a deadpan expression, given the moniker \"Craig\" by internet commenters, became aninternet meme, and was embraced by 343 Industries' community director Brian Jarrard.[101]When 343 Industries released improved gameplay videos closer toHalo Infinite'srelease, they included shots that purposely showed an improvement in visuals and appearance of \"Craig\", which character and combat director Steve Dyck and character art lead Bryan Repka considered a \"glow-up\", and that the community response to \"Craig\" was \"one of the factors in gaining some more time to finish work and get Brutes to a place where the team is happy with them\".[102]A reference to \"Craig\" in the form of anEaster eggwas added toHalo Infinite'scampaign.[103]\n\nIn October 2020, 343 Industries announced changes to the player color system inInfinite, replacing the system of primary and secondary colors in pastHalogames with \"coatings\" based on layers of patterns and markings designed to enable \"greater player expression\". 343 plans to make coatings available throughmicrotransactionsas well as rewards for purchasing tie-in products such asMonster Energydrinks,Mondelez-branded snacks, and other items.[104]The plan was received negatively, with fans and critics expressing concern about the impact of microtransactions.[105][106]343 Industries' community manager John Junyszek defended the system, stating that it enabled \"greater detail and variation\" and that other methods of obtaining coatings would be made available as \"special rewards\" in addition to paid purchases.[107]\n\nIn contrast to the game's initial gameplay reveal,Halo Infinite's multiplayer beta release in August 2021 received praise, particularly for its gameplay improvements.[108][109][110]The multiplayer'sBattle Passsystem, however, received criticism for its slow progression;[111][112]in response, 343 adjusted the battle pass progression to speed up progress.[113]\n\nHalo Infinitereceived \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according toreview aggregatorwebsiteMetacritic.[115][114]GamesRadarsummarized it by saying \"Haloas you've never seen it before\"[121]andEurogamercalled the release ofHalo Infinitein the series \"the best it's been in a decade\".[127]\n\nTechRadarwroteHalo Infinitewas \"a triumph\", saying \"From its captivating story to its liberating gameplay, developer 343 Industries has created a campaign that will resonate with veteranHalofans and inspire a new generation of players.\"[128]IGNbelieved theHaloseries to still belong amongst the best shooter games, especially praisingHalo Infinite's single-player campaign[129]and multiplayer, though considered the rewards gained in the latter's Battle Pass to be lackluster.[130]The game's use ofopen worlddesign and greater player freedom in certain areas received particular praise from others.[131][132][133]Additionally,GameSpoteditor Jordan Ramée praised the game's newgrappleshotfeature and rewarding single-player progression system.[120]\n\nPCMagcomplimented the soundtrack for providing \"a mix of atmospheric exploration music, thrilling combat tracks, and songs and compositions that exist somewhere in between\".[125]PCGamesNpraised the feel of each gun and engaging variety of the arsenal, saying \"switching to the plasma rifle to knock the shield off a Jackal and then back to the VK78 Commando to get a snappy headshot never gets old\".[124]While praising the combat,PC Gamerwere mixed on the level design of \"lush forests, valleys and marine-rescue setup\", finding it strongly evoked the mission Halo fromCombat Evolved, but felt inferior to \"the timeless design of The Silent Cartographer, or evenHalo 3's less-fondly remembered meat labyrinth, Cortana\".[123]Rock Paper Shotgunliked the world design, but criticized the plot as being held back by prior entries, \"Infinite's story is still ankle-clamped by the overindulgence of its predecessors, even though it does what it can to shrink things down into a tighter, more coherent spacetale\".[134]\n\nThe game was selected byGame Informeras theirGame of the Year.[135]\n\nBy January 2022,Halo Infinitehad reached 20 million players.[136]",

    "content": "\n\nHalois amilitary science fictionvideo game seriesandmedia franchise, originally developed byBungieand currently managed and developed byHalo Studios(previously 343 Industries), part ofMicrosoft'sXbox Game Studios. The series launched in November 2001 with thefirst-person shootervideo gameHalo: Combat Evolvedand its tie-in novel,The Fall of Reach. The latest major installment,Halo Infinite, was released in 2021. Spinoffs includereal-time strategyandtwin-stick shootergames.\n\nBungie began as a developer of computer games for the Macintosh platform. After the company was acquired by Microsoft in 2000, their in-progress game, which started life as areal-time strategy game, becameHalo: Combat Evolved, afirst-person shooterexclusive to Microsoft'sXboxvideo game. Following the success ofHalo, Bungie developed additionalHalosequels before and after regaining its independence from Microsoft in 2007. Microsoft established 343 Industries to overseeHalogoing forward, producing games itself and in partnership with other studios.\n\nHalo: Combat Evolvedwas the Xbox's flagship \"killer app\" and cemented Microsoft as a major competitor in the video game console space, and its sequels pioneered online matchmaking, social features, and video game marketing. The games have sold more than 81 million copies worldwide. With more than $6 billion in franchise sales,Halois one of thehighest-grossing media franchises of all time, spanning novels, graphic novels, comic books, short films, animated films, feature films, fan-made shortmachinimaanimations andother licensed products.\n\nMany millions of years ago, a species known as the Precursors assumed the Mantle of Responsibility – the guardianship of life in the galaxy. The Precursors chose an ancient form of humanity as their successors, over another species known as the Forerunners. In retaliation, the Forerunners attacked their former masters and drove the Precursors into extinction. Instead of fighting back, the Precursors allowed themselves to die, with some turning into dust intended to spread and later transform into themselves once again. This dust eventually became defective, infecting and contorting organisms into a new parasitic species, connected by a hivemind to the minds of the last Precursors: theFlood. TheForerunnerssent the humans to Earth, reverting them to a primitive civilization based in Africa, and fought the Flood, which spread through an infestation of sentient life and overran much of theMilky Way Galaxy. Exhausting all other strategies, the Forerunners conceived theHalo Array— ring-shaped megastructures and weapons of last resort that would destroy all sentient life in the galaxy to stop the Flood. A civil war began between the Forerunners' commander, known as the Ur-Didact, who wanted to assimilate all the humans on Earth into his army as AIs, thus immune to the Flood, and his wife, the Librarian, who created the Ark, an instrument that was to shelter sentient species outside the galaxy and allow for the mass creation of Halo installations which could all be activated simultaneously. The Librarian, along with all the remaining Forerunners, trapped her husband inside a Forerunner repository of knowledge known as the Domain, and disappeared as the Array was activated, thus destroying all sentient life in the galaxy and ending the outbreak of the Flood— though some Forerunners are known to have left the Milky Way galaxy for a different, unknown galaxy.\n\nNearly a hundred thousand years later, in the 26th century, humanity—under the auspices of the Unified Earth Government, or UEG, and their United Nations Space Command, or UNSC— has colonized many worlds thanks to the development of faster-than-light \"slipstream space\" (i.e.,hyperspace) travel. Tensions between the government and colonies desiring independence sparked violent clashes. The UNSC's Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) created the SPARTAN-II Project to create an elite group of enhancedsupersoldiersto suppress the rebellions covertly. In the year 2525, human worlds came under attack by atheocraticalliance of alien races known as theCovenant, whose leadership declared humanity heretics and an affront to their gods: the Forerunners. The Covenant began a genocidal holy war. Their superior technology and numbers proved to be decisive advantages; although effective, the Spartans were too few to turn the tide of battle in humanity's favor. After the Covenant invaded Reach in 2552, the UNSC's last major stronghold besides Earth,Master Chief John-117was left as one of the few remaining Spartans.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Halo rings prompts a desperate battle against the Covenant, who believe they are instruments of transcendence, not destruction. Master Chief and his artificial intelligenceCortanaare instrumental in the destruction of a Halo ring to stop the Covenant and the threat of the Flood. The assassination of one of the Covenant high prophets, turmoil within the Covenant, and the revelation of the Halo Array's true purpose leads to civil war. The disgraced former Covenant Sangheili commander known as theArbiter, along with many of his species, helps the humans stop the Prophet of Truth from activating the Halo Array via the Ark. The Human-Covenant War ends, though new conflicts begin to emerge throughout the universe.\n\nIn the post-war era, the UNSC trains a new generation of Spartans, and tensions between the UNSC and colonist rebels resumes. The Master Chief and Cortana accidentally free the Didact and he briefly returns to assert supremacy over humanity. Master Chief and Cortana halt his plans, although Cortana is initially believed dead in the attempt. Cortana's survival through the Domain leads her to break with the UNSC and assert a newhegemonyover the galaxy, with artificial intelligence (the \"Created\") in control.[1]After two years of a scattered war between Cortana and the UNSC, Cortana attacks the Banished, a mercenary organization largely led by the Jiralhanae species. The Banished win the resultant conflict, terminating Cortana and battling the UNSC for control of Zeta Halo.[2]\n\nVideo game studioBungiewas founded in 1991 byAlex Seropianin Chicago, Illinois, who partnered with programmerJason Jonesthe following year to market and release Jones' gameMinotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete. Focusing on theMacgame market because it was smaller and easier to compete, Bungie became a preeminent game developer on the platform, releasing the successfulMythandMarathon. Bungie began development on a new game in 1998, referring to it by the temporary code names \"Monkey Nuts\" and later \"Blam!\" after Jones could not bring himself to say the previous codename to his mother.[3][4]: ix\"Blam!\" was conceived as a science fictionreal-time strategygame and took place on a hollowed-out world called Solipsis. The planet eventually became aringworldcalled \"Halo\", in turn giving the game its title.[3]\n\nAs the development team began experimenting with incorporating vehicles with realistic physics simulations, they began moving the distant third-person camera closer to the action. Bungie decided it would be more fun to directly control units than direct them, and the game shifted to a third-person shooter.[3][5]Halowas announced on July 21, 1999, during theMacworld Conference & Expo. The title of the game was finalized only days before it was announced at Macworld.[5]\n\nBungie was undergoing financial difficulties, andMicrosoftwas looking for games for its upcomingXboxvideo game console. In June 2000, Microsoft announced their acquisition of Bungie, andHalo—now having morphed into afirst-person shooter—became a launch title for the Xboxvideo game console.[3][5]Relocated from Chicago to Redmond, Washington, Bungie had roughly 14 months to finish the game before the Xbox launched. The story slowly began to take shape, with an internal debate at Bungie over how much personality to give the main character. WriterJoe Statenwanted to do more than have the player character be an \"empty vessel\" likeHalf-Life'sGordon Freeman, so they wrote him with a sense of humor. Deciding he should be referred to by his naval rank, Bungie decided on \"Master Chief\". Despite a difficult and hectic development schedule,Halo: Combat Evolvedshipped as a launch title for the Xbox on November 15, 2001.[3][5][6]: 112–113The Xbox's marketing heavily featuredHalo, whose green color palette meshed with the console's design scheme.[7]Halowas a critical and commercial success, selling alongside half of every Xbox sold.[8]By July 2006, the game had sold 4.2 million copies and earned $170 million in the United States.[9]\n\nHalo: Combat Evolvedintroduced many elements common to the franchise. Players battle enemies on foot and in vehicles to complete objectives across a mysterious alien landscape.Halolimited the number of weapons players could carry to two, forcing them to carefully select their preferred armament.[10]Players fight with ranged and melee attacks, as well as grenades. Bungie referred to the \"weapons-grenades-melee\" format as the \"Golden Triangle ofHalo\".[11]The player's has health measured inhit pointsthat must be replenished with health packs, but also has a perpetually recharging energy shield.[12]\n\nWhileHalohad not been intended as a franchise, the Bungie team wanted to make an ambitious sequel, looking to story and gameplay ideas that had been ultimately cut fromCombat Evolved, and inspired by how fans had received the game.[5][13]In particular, Bungie was surprised by how many fans used theSystem Linkcapability to network consoles together and play multiplayer inLAN parties. With the launch of theXbox Liveonline multiplayer service, Bungie wanted to bringHalomultiplayer to the internet.[13]\n\nHalo 2, was announced on August 8, 2002, at Microsoft'sX02press event,[14]and an impressive demo of the game was shown at Electronic Entertainment Expo the following year. The demo showed off new features like dual-wielding weapons and hijacking enemy vehicles, but behind the scenes the game was undergoing a troubled development; Bungie had to scrap the ambitious graphics engine as it would not run effectively on the Xbox hardware, leadership changes resulted in more infighting, and artists and designers wasted time developing assets that would ultimately not ship in the game. A planned massive multiplayer mode was entirely cut, leading to developerMax Hoberman's smaller-scale local mode becoming the only multiplayer offering. As the game's release date slipped, the studio entered a sustained period of crunch to finish the game, with other Bungie games being canceled and their staff absorbed into theHaloteam.[3][5][13]The final act of the game had to be cut entirely in the rush to complete the game.[5]Halo 2was released on the Xbox onNovember 9, 2004, and later forWindows Vistaon May 17, 2007.[citation needed]Part of the marketing took the form of analternative reality game,I Love Bees, centered around a website apparently hacked by a mysterious intelligence. Over the course of the game, audio clips were released that formed a narrative set on Earth betweenHaloandHalo 2.[15]Halo 2was a critical and commercial success, grossing $125 million in the first day and becoming the highest-grossing release in entertainment history up to that point; it would ultimately sell 8 million copies, becoming the best-selling Xbox game.[citation needed]Halo 2was also a significant motivator for subscriptions to the Xbox Live multiplayer service.[16]\n\nFrustrated by the development ofHalo 2and wanting to move on to new non-Haloprojects, Bungie wanted to wrap things up in a satisfying manner withHalo 3. Burned out byHalo 2, Jason Jones went on an extended sabbatical, and theHalo 3effort started without direction as no one was definitively in charge. Designer Paul Bertone recalled that the large development staff (70–80 people) meant more meetings and less efficiency. Multiple staff members temporarily or permanently departed the development team, including Hoberman, who started his own studio,Certain Affinityafter developingHalo 3's online systems. Despite the difficult development, overallHalo 3's development went more smoothly thanHalo 2.[5]Halo 3was announced at the 2006Electronic Entertainment Expo,[17]and released on theXbox 360on September 25, 2007.[citation needed]It added new gameplay elements, including deployable equipment and heavy weapons.[18]The game also added a limited map-editing tool, known as Forge, which allows players to insert game objects, such as weapons and vehicles, into existing multiplayer map geometry.[citation needed]A saved films feature allowed players to record gameplay and review it from any angle.[19]Backed by an extensive marketing campaign,Halo 3was a critical and commercial success, grossing $170million in the U.S. in the first 24 hours.[20]The game was the best-selling title of the year in the U.S., and the fourteenth best-selling game of the2000s.[21]\n\nLingering dissatisfaction with Bungie's acquisition by Microsoft in 2000 and a desire for more favorable profit-sharing onHalo 3led to an agreement where Bungie would become an independent studio after shipping a set number of newHalogames.[5]Bungie announced their independence in October 2007.[22]They were contractually obligated to produce two moreHalogames as part of the deal. One project turned into the gameHalo: Reach, while the other was initially going to be a production withPeter Jackson's Wingnut Interactive. When that project was scrapped, Bungie took elements prototyped for it and added them to a smallerHalo 3expansion, originally titledHalo 3: Recon.[5]\n\nProduced using theHalo 3engine and assets and with a smaller staff of only around 20 full-time employees,Recon—later renamedHalo 3: ODST—was conceived as a noir detective story, with the player character uncovering clues in a hub world that triggered playable flashbacks. The player had flexibility to explore and play missions in any order. Bungie staffers recalled that getting resources for the game was tough, as most of the studio's attention was onHalo: Reach.[5]In the game, players assume the role of weaker Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODSTs) rather than Spartan supersoldiers; lost health must be replenished with scrounged health packs. A VISR mode illuminates dark environments and highlights friends and foes, and the player is equipped with new equipment, such as silenced submachine guns and pistols. In addition to shipping with the completeHalo 3multiplayer,ODSTalso added a cooperativesurvival modecalled Firefight, where players fight against waves of enemies with limited lives.[citation needed]Halo 3: ODSTreleased September 22, 2009, and was positively received, though its price as a full game, rather than a cheaper expansion, was occasionally criticized.[5][23]It was the top-selling title of the month in the U.S. and ultimately sold more than three million copies worldwide.[citation needed]\n\nTired of focusing on the character of Master Chief, Bungie castHalo: Reachas a prequel toCombat Evolved, taking place on the doomed human world of Reach as it falls under attack from the Covenant.[5]The step backwards in the timeline was mirrored by the gameplay, which Bungie wanted to harken toCombat Evolvedwith more open environments and exploration, and the return of health packs.[23]Among the new additions were the replacement of single-use equipment with persistent armor abilities that enables sprinting, jetpacks, or temporary invincibility.[24]The game's release was preceded by an beta to help balance the game and squash bugs.[25]Reachreleased September 14, 2010 and was a success, making $200 million its first day and selling more than 4.7 million units by September 2011.[26][27]\n\nWhile Bungie finished their association withHalo, the rights to the franchise remained with Microsoft.[22]Bonnie Ross, Xbox general manager at the time, recalled that her colleagues feltHalowas a waning property and wanted to outsource new game development,[28][29]: 21:45–23:00while Ross argued for an internal studio.[29]: 26:15–27:05Ross' vision won out, and she was put in charge of a new internalHalostudio, 343 Industries, named after the character343 Guilty Spark.[30][31][32][33]The studio started with a small staff in late 2007.[29]: 28:22\n\nWhile 343 Industries worked with Bungie onODSTandReach, the new company's first game project wasHalo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, aremasterof the franchise's debut title. The game was developed in partnership withSaber Interactive, with 343 Industries handling creative and Saber the engineering.[29]: 29:00–30:55Saber had just one year to develop the game in anticipation ofCombat Evolved's tenth anniversary.[34]Players can switch between the original graphics and updated visuals with a button press.[35]Both classic and new graphics are presented inhigh-definition,16:9widescreen compared to the original game's480iresolution and4:3aspect ratio.[36]Certain Affinity helped develop multiplayer maps for the game, beginning a long collaboration between the two studios.[5]Reviews were generally positive,[37]though critics disagreed if the original, unaltered gameplay held up to modern standards.[38][39]\n\n343 Industries began staffing up their studio while beginning development on the next majorHalotitle, eventually growing to nearly 200,[40]and decided where they wanted to take Master Chief's story over the course of future games.Ryan Paytonwas initially offered the role of creative director, but his ideas for the game did not mesh with the expected first-person shooter focus, and before prototyping was done Payon was replaced and ultimately left in 2011.Josh Holmestook over as creative designer, and the studio shifted focus from ideating to producing the game in earnest. The end result was a more safe, straightforward sequel toHalo 3.[5]Holmes wanted the game's story mode to explore Master Chief's relationship with Cortana, who would break down into adementia-like state.[41]Struggling with making the plot accessible for new players,[40]the team considered dropping the storyline. Holmes, drawing inspiration from his own mother's battle with dementia, insisted it stayed in.[41]\n\nHalo 4was announced atE32011 and released November 6, 2012.[42][43]The game picks up years after the events ofHalo 3, as Master Chief and Cortana fight against a reawakened Forerunner.[citation needed]The game achieved record first-day sales for the franchise.[44]While reviews were generally positive,[45]the story was dinged for being incomprehensible to casual players and relying on knowledge of the wider franchise media.[46]\n\nIntending to create a 10th anniversary edition ofHalo 2, like they had withCombat Evolved, 343 Industries, Saber Interactive, Certain Affinity and other studios collaborated onHalo: The Master Chief Collection, repackingCombat Evolved Anniversary,Halo 2 Anniversary,Halo 3andHalo 4in a single collection for theXbox Oneconsole. The launch was marred with glitches and matchmaking issues, which required numerous patches to fix.[47]Ross apologized to fans for the state of the game, and promised futureHalogames would have public betas.[48]ReachandODSTwere subsequently added to the collection, which was ported to PC and received enhancements for theXbox Series X.[49]\n\n343 Industries' next installment,Halo 5: Guardians, was announced in 2014.[50]The game takes place across many worlds, mainly the Elite homeworld, and revolves around Spartan Locke's hunt for the rogue Master Chief, who is trying to find a still-living Cortana.[51]\n\nThe third part of the Reclaimer Saga,Halo Infinite, was announced duringE3 2018.[52]It brings the focus back to Master Chief, and Halo's roots by taking place on the new Zeta Halo. The story mainly focuses on exploring the deeper lore of theHaloseries, finding what happened to Cortana, and battles with the Banished.[2]It released December 2021.[53]\n\nOn October 6, 2024, 343 Industries unveiled a seven-minute video where they officially announced their rebranding as Halo Studios, while also confirming that multiple new games in the series were currently in development, and that said games would useUnreal Engine 5as opposed to the proprietary Slipspace Engine.[54]Studio head Pierre Hintze explained that the decision to rebrand the studio came from an internal shift in development philosophy behind the franchise, giving the team a \"clean break\" as was the case with transitioning between Bungie and 343.[55]\n\nHaloreturned to its real-time strategy roots withHalo Wars, developed byEnsemble Studiosfor the Xbox 360 and released in 2009. The game takes place 21 years prior to the events ofHalo: Combat Evolved.[citation needed]Ensemble focused their efforts on developing a control scheme that was simple and intuitive for console strategy games, traditionally considered inferior to their keyboard-and-mouse-driven computer game siblings.[citation needed]The game received generally positive reviews from critics,[56]and sold an estimated 2.6 million units, a massive success for the genre on consoles.[57]Halo Warswas Ensemble's last project as a studio before shuttering; post-release updates and content were developed byRobot Entertainment.[58]A sequel,Halo Wars 2, was developed byCreative Assemblyand released on Xbox One and PC platforms simultaneously in February 2017.[57]\n\nInterested in bringingHaloto mobile devices, 343 Industries partnered with Vanguard Games to produceHalo: Spartan Assault, atwin-stick shooterinitially released onWindows 8tablets and phones in 2013; the game later came to the Xbox One andiOSplatforms.[citation needed]Spartan Assaultwas followed by a sequel,Halo: Spartan Strike, in 2015.[59]\n\nOtherHalospinoffs include avirtual realityexperience,Halo Recruit,[60]andHalo: Fireteam Raven, a coin-operatedarcade gamedeveloped byRaw Thrillsand PlayMechanix released in 2018, starting with Round1 USA andDave & Buster'sarcades.[61]Fireteam Raven takes place during the events of Halo: Combat Evolved and puts the players in control of up to four ODST Members battling Covenant forces and the Flood within 6 levels.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2000s, spin-off titles were rumored or pitched for theGame Boy Advance,[62]Gizmondo,[63]Ultra-Mobile PC,[64]andNintendo DS.[65]An episodic video game,Halo: Chronicles, was announced in 2006. To be developed by film director Peter Jackson's Wingnut Interactive, it was canceled as part of budget cuts tied to job layoffs in January 2009.[66]Ensemble Studios developed aHalo-themedmassively multiplayer online game,Titan. The project was canceled internally in 2007–2008, as Microsoft lost interest in a PC-based game.[65][67]Certain Affinity was slated to develop their ownHalotitle, but it was never greenlit because the team was needed to develop the Halo Waypoint online portal instead. AMega Bloks-branded spinoff game, similar to the style ofLego video games, was prototyped for the Xbox 360 but not pursued; footage of the game leaked several years later in 2017.[65]\n\n343 Industries announced afree-to-playHalomultiplayer game for Windows PC,Halo Online, in 2015. The game launched with a closedbeta testlimited to Russia that year. The title was developed with Saber Interactive using modified version of theHalo 3engine, and published by Innova Systems. The project was canceled in August 2016.[65][68]Players modified the game to circumvent the region limitations and add new content after the project's official cancellation.[69]This \"ElDewrito\" project saw legal takedowns from Microsoft for violating its game usage rules.[70]The modders claimed its ElDewrito's popularity hastened Microsoft's plans to release a Windows version ofHalo: The Master Chief Collection, which would later include content fromHalo Online.[71][72]\n\nIn 2006, in acknowledgment of the \"wealth of influences adopted by the Bungie team\", a list of Bungie employees' favorite science fiction material was published on the company's website.[73]The developers acknowledged that theHaloseries' use of ring-shapedmegastructuresfollowed on from concepts featured inLarry Niven'sRingworldandIain M. Banks'Culture series(of whichConsider Phlebas[74]andExcession[73]were said to be particularly influential). In a retrospective article inEdge, Bungie's Jaime Griesemer commented, \"The influence of something likeRingworldisn't necessarily in the design—it's in that feeling of being somewhere else. That sense of scale and an epic story going on out there.\"[74]Griesemer also explained, \"One of the main sources of inspiration wasArmor[byJohn Steakley], in which a soldier has to constantly re-live the same war over and over again. That sense of hopelessness, a relentless battle, was influential.\"[74]The Flood were influenced by the assimilating alien species inChristopher Rowley'sThe Vang;[74]it has also been speculated that the Master Chief's name \"John 117\" may have been a reference to a character named Jon 6725416 in Rowley'sStarhammer,[75]or to the John Spartan character ofDemolition Man.[76]An IGN article exploring the literary influences present in theHalofranchise commented on similarities betweenHaloandOrson Scott Card'sEnder's Game: aspects of theSPARTAN Projectand the design of the Covenant Drones are perceived as reminiscent of the super soldier program and Buggers found in the novel.[75]Bungie has also acknowledgedJames Cameron's filmAliensas a strong cinematic influence.[77]\n\nA report written by Roger Travis and published byThe EscapistcomparesHalowith the Latin epicAeneid, written by classical Roman poetVirgil. Travis posits similarities between the plots of both works and compares the characters present in them, with the Flood and Covenant taking the role performed by the Carthaginians and Master Chief taking the role ofAeneas.[78]\n\nPlayers began creating impromptuHalotournaments and local parties after the release of the first game. Bungie looked at the success of these matches as inspiration for crafting the online multiplayer components ofHalo 2.[79]\n\nLarger organizations soon began operatingHalocompetitive games. In August 2002,G4hosted the Halo National Championship Finals, a FFA [free-for-all] tournament involving sixteen players from across the country (hosted byWil WheatonofStar Trekfame.)[80]The Associates of Gaming Professionals (AGP), which focused solely onHalo, held its first event in November 2002.[81]Inspired by friends placing bets on theirHalomatches, Mike Sepso and Sundance DiGiovanni formedMajor League Gamingthe same year.[82]\n\nMicrosoft and 343 Industries sponsored their own professionalHaloleague, called theHalo Championship Series(HCS), in 2014.[83]It was started in partnership with theElectronic Sports League(ESL). Seasons 1 and 2 ran onThe Master Chief Collection.[84]In August 2015 Microsoft announced it would be increasing the total prize pool of the HCS to US$1 million, for the newly announced Halo World Championship, which will be the debut event forHalo 5.[85]This prize pool was later announced to be crowd-funded, which later resulted inMajor League Gamingannouncing that the prize pool had climbed to US$2 million. Later that week, 343 announced that the prize pool was locked at US$2.5 million. This was the largest console esports prize pool ever.[86]\n\nFirst introduced inHalo 3, Forge is an in-game map editor designed for adjusting weapon, vehicle, and prop placement. While in Editor Mode, the player becomes a floating robot, or \"monitor\", who can spawn, move, and delete any game object on the map. All objects are assigned a monetary value, and cost money to spawn; the level's \"Forge budget\" determines how much money the player can use to spawn objects. As a component ofHalo 3, Forge received critical acclaim upon its release.GameSpot'sJeff Gerstmanndescribed Forge as \"an extremely powerful addition that might just take over your life\", and praised the editor for the replay value it provided.[87]Heather CampbellofPlay MagazinenamedHalo 3her game of the year due to Forge, with co-editor Greg Orlando explaining later in the issue: \"What separatesHalo 3from other console shooters such asCall of Duty 4: Modern WarfareandTeam Fortress 2, though, is the inclusion of a forge mode and the ability to save and edit gameplay films. [...] Although these modes are standard fare in most PC online shooters, their inclusion in a console game is something entirely new – and entirely wonderful.\"[88]In an editorial forEdge, N'Gai Croal stated that Forge could \"help prove the viability ofuser-generated contenton consoles.\"[89]Halo 3's iteration of Forge has received comparisons toGarry's Mod, a 2004Half-Life 2mod with a similar emphasis on free-form construction and experimentation.[90][91][87]\n\nOutside of its intended use as a map editor, Forge has been used to create art installations by arranging in-game props to draw pictures and write messages.[92]Game modes and maps created in Forge have occasionally informed the development ofHaloitself. Grifball, a fictional sport that originated in theHalo-themed web seriesRed vs. Blue, inspired a popular user-created Forge map and game mode styled afterrugby. Grifball was developed into an official weekly playlist forHalo 3, and would go on to be included in every subsequentHalogame afterHalo: Reach.[93]\n\n343 Industries employee Nick Bird, working as Forge Quality Assurance onHalo Infinite, credited Forge for his interest in game development; \"My time in Forge and the Forge community eventually led me to pursue a career in the industry, and ultimately landed me a position to work on what I love in a franchise I love.\"[94]\n\nMartin O'DonnellandMichael Salvatoricollaborated to produce the soundtracks for Bungie'sHalogames. Approached by Bungie to produce something ancient and mysterious forHalo's debut, O'Donnell decided to useGregorian chant, joining in with others to sing the vocal parts.[5]The music was designed to change dynamically based on what was occurring in-game;[95]for a more enjoyable listening experience on the soundtrack releases, O'Donnell arranged the music into standalonesuites.[96]ForHalo 2, the soundtrack included licensed music fromIncubusandBreaking Benjaminalongside the orchestral score; rock guitar virtuoso,Steve Vai, performed various solos throughout the score.[citation needed]\n\nForHalo 3, O'Donnell noted he wanted to bring back the themes from the original game to help tie together the end of the trilogy.[97]The tracks are presented, similarly to theprevious soundtrack forHalo 2,[98]in a suite form. Unlike previous soundtracks, where much of the music had been synthesized on computer, the soundtrack forHalo 3was recorded using a 60-piece orchestra, along with a 24-voice chorus.[99][100][101]A soundtrack forHalo 3: ODSTwas released alongside the game and included many of the tracks from the game.[102]For Bungie's last game in the Halo series,Halo: Reach, Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori returned to compose the soundtrack. O'Donnell wrote \"somber, more visceral\" music to reflect the darker nature of the campaign and style of the game. As Bungie had been makingHalo 3: ODSTandHalo: Reachat the same time, Martin O'Donnell had also been composing the soundtracks at the same time, but production for the music ofHalo: Reachdid not begin until after the release ofHalo 3: ODST.[citation needed]\n\nThe music ofHalohelped spur a renewed interest in chant music.[103]\n\nForHalo Wars, the task of creating the game's music fell toStephen Rippy. Rippy listened to O'Donnell's soundtracks for inspiration and incorporated theHalotheme into parts of his arrangements. In addition to synthesized and orchestral components, the composer focused on the choir and piano as essential elements, feeling these were important in creating the \"Halosound\".[104]\n\nThe music ofHalo 4was composed byNeil Davidgeand Kazuma Jinnouchi. TheHalo 4 Original Soundtrackwas released on October 22, 2012, followed by a two-disc Special Edition on November 6. Neil Davidge served as an out-of-house composer for 343 Industries which proved to be very expensive leading Kazuma Jinnouchi to take over the responsibility of music production forHalo 5: Guardians. The music by Neil Davidge and Kazuma Jinnouchi forHalo 4received mixed reviews, being recognized as creative music but too different from the original Halo formula. Jinnouchi returned to compose the music forHalo 5: Guardians.\n\nIn 2017, 343 Industries andCreative Assemblyreleased a sequel toHalo WarstitledHalo Wars 2. The soundtrack was composed byGordy Haab, Brian Lee White and Brian Trifon under the direction of Paul Lipson who had helped in the audio and music of nearly every previous Halo title. TheHalo Wars 2soundtrack featured many melodies from the music that Stephen Rippy had composed for the firstHalo Warsbut with new arrangements and more melodies to represent the individual characters. The original game soundtrack was released on February 17, 2017, and released digitally on February 21, 2017.\n\nThe music forHalo Infinitewas a collaboration betweenGareth Coker, Curtis Schweitzer,Joel Corelitz, Alex Bhore, and Eternal Time & Space, overseen by 343 Industries Music Supervisor Joel Yarger.Infinite's soundtrack was released digitally on December 8, 2021, in two albums, one covering the score for the campaign, and another covering the music for the game's multiplayer component.\n\nTheHalofranchise includes various types of merchandise and adaptations outside of the video games. This includes bestselling novels, graphic novels, and other licensed products, from action figures to a packaging tie-in withMountain Dew.[citation needed]Numerous action figures and vehicles based onHalohave been produced. Joyride Studios createdHaloandHalo 2action figures, whileHalo 3poseable and collectible action figures, aimed at collectors, were produced byMcFarlane Toysand became some of the top-selling action figures of 2007 and 2008.[105]MEGA Blokshas partnered with Microsoft to produceHalo-themed toys.[106]\n\nAs part of Microsoft's multimedia efforts, Microsoft Studios decided to create a tie-in novel forCombat Evolved.Eric NylundwroteHalo: The Fall of Reachin seven weeks, and it was published in October 2001.[citation needed]Nylund would write additionalHaloworks including the novelsFirst Strike(2003) andGhosts of Onyx(2006).[citation needed]The game itself was turned into a novelization byWilliam C. Dietzin 2003, calledHalo: The Flood.[citation needed]Other novels have been written byJoseph Staten(Contact Harvest),Tobias S. Buckell,Karen Traviss,Greg Bear(The Forerunner Saga),Matt Forbeck,John Shirley,Troy Denning,Cassandra Rose Clarke, andKelly Gay.[107]\n\nA collection ofHaloshort stories,Halo: Evolutions, was simultaneously released in print and audiobook formats in November 2009.Evolutionsincludes original material by Nylund, Buckell, Traviss, and contributions from Bungie.[108]Tor re-released the first threeHalonovels with new content and cover art.[109]Another collection,Halo: Fractures, compiled new and previously released short fiction in 2016.[110]\n\nTheHalouniverse was adapted into comics in 2006 with the release ofThe Halo Graphic Novel, a collection of fourshort storiespublished byMarvel Comics. Marvel produced a number of otherHalocomic series.Halo: Uprising, byBrian Michael BendisandAlex Maleev, bridges the gap between the events ofHalo 2andHalo 3;[111]initially planned to conclude shortly before the release ofHalo 3in 2007, delays led to the final issue being published April 2009.[citation needed]Two additional comic runs were announced in 2009.[112]Peter David's series,Halo: Helljumper, is set prior toHalo: Combat Evolvedand focuses on the elite Orbital Drop Shock Troopers. The five-part series was published between July and November 2009.[113]Fred Van Lente's series,Halo: Blood Line, revolves around a black ops team of Spartan supersoldiers assigned to the UNSC Office of Naval Intelligence,[114]and debuted in December 2009.[115]Marvel also released a three-part comic adaptation of the novelHalo: The Fall of Reachin 2011.[116]\n\nDark Horse Comics has produced a number ofHaloseries, beginning with the three-part seriesHalo: Initiation, released in August 2013.[117]Also announced wasHalo: Escalation, an ongoing comic series covering the period directly afterHalo 4; it ran for 24 issues from 2013 to 2015.[118][citation needed]\n\nIn 2005,Columbia Picturespresident Peter Schlessel began working outside the studio system to produce aHalofilm adaptation.Alex Garlandwrote a script,[119]which was then pitched to studios by couriers dressed as Master Chief. Microsoft's terms required $10 million against 15 percent of gross; most studios passed, citing the lack of risk for Microsoft compared to their large share of potential profits.20th Century FoxandUniversal Picturesdecided to partner to produce the film, paying Microsoft $5 million to option the film and 10 percent of grosses.[120]Peter Jacksonwas slated to be the executive producer,[121]withNeill Blomkampas director. Before Blomkamp signed on,Guillermo del Torowas in negotiations to direct.[122]\n\nD. B. WeissandJosh Olsonrewrote Garland's script during 2006.[123]Pre-production of the film was halted and restarted several times.[124]Later that year, 20th Century Fox threatened to pull out of the project, leading Universal to issue an ultimatum to Jackson and Schlessel: either reduce their large\"first-dollar\"revenue deals, or the project was ended. Both refused, and the project stalled.[120]Blomkamp would produce a series of live-action shorts as promotion forHalo 3, collectively titledHalo: Landfall.[125]The rights for the film reverted to Microsoft.[126]\n\nHalo 4: Forward Unto Dawnis a live-action film and miniseries set in the Halo universe. Although shot as a feature-length film,Forward Unto Dawnwas originally released as a webseries consisting of five episodes released between October 5, 2012, and November 2, 2012. The series' plot, occurring in the early days of the Human-Covenant War, revolves around Thomas Lasky, a young cadet at Corbulo Academy of Military Science, and how John-117 inspired him to eventually become a leader. Lasky is also a prominent character inHalo 4as a commander on the UNSC Infinity. The name of the series, aside from being a reference to the UNSC frigateForward Unto Dawn, is given new significance in the series as part of a running motif based on a poem. The film cut was released on Blu-ray and DVD on December 4, 2012.\n\nOn April 3, 2014, it was announced thatRidley Scottand his production company,Scott Free Productions, were working on aHalodigital feature alongside 343 Industries andXbox Entertainment Studios; Scott would be the executive producer, withDavid W. ZuckerandSergio Mimica-Gezzanas the directors. The feature was expected to follow the same format as Machinima'sHalo 4: Forward Unto Dawn.[127]On June 9, 2014, it was announced at E3 2014 that the feature, titledHalo: Nightfall, would be included withHalo: The Master Chief Collectionat its November 2014 launch. The feature introduces a new character to the franchise, Agent Jameson Locke, played by actorMike Colter;Nightfallis considered to be his origin story.[128]Locke is one of the Spartans portrayed on the cover art and plays a large role in the series.[129]On July 24, 2014, 343 Industries released the first trailer for the feature.[130]Halo: Nightfallis available to watch through Halo Channel, an application for the Xbox One, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone.[131]On March 16, 2015, the series became available to stream, download, and buy on physical disc.[132]\n\nOn May 21, 2013,Xbox Entertainment Studiosand 343 announced that a live-action television show ofHalowould be produced withSteven Spielbergserving as executive producer through what is nowAmblin Television.

Martens also felt that the series sacrificed some of the \"silliness\" from the games.[59]Marcus Lehto, one of the co-creators ofHalo: Combat Evolved(2001), stated that the show is \"not theHaloI made\", but later stated that he \"never said [he] didn't like it\".[60]\n\nThe second season received a more positive reception from critics,[55]with some declaring it to be a big improvement over the first season.[61][62]Hayden Mears of IGN gave a 7/10 rating to the second season's first four episodes, stating that the season is \"leagues more coherent and inspired than the first\".[63]\n\nMaster Chiefhas been described as acting out of character compared to his core canon counterpart,[59]and Kwan Ha, an original character created for the Silver Timeline canon, has received negative reception due to her story being perceived as too \"disjointed\" and \"divorced\" from the main plotline of the series and theHalouniverse.[64][65][66]\n\nThesex scenebetween Master Chief/John and Makee, another major original character created for the Silver Timeline canon, in the eighth episode of the first season, has received a polarized reaction from audiences and critics alike; discussions have included whether the scene was \"contrived and forced\",[67]whether Master Chief commits awar crimeby having sex with aprisoner of warwho is unable to properly provide herconsent, and whether this is atypical behavior of Master Chief in comparison to the core canon (this is the first time John has sex in either the core or Silver canons).[68]\n\nKiki Wolfkill, the studio head oftransmediaat343 Industriesand an executive producer of the show, defended the addition of the scene, stating that while the creative team had \"a lot of conversation leading up to whether to do that or not and... there's a lot of different opinions and voices\", that the scene was necessary in order to humanize John by providing him with \"a human connection with someone\" in order to end the season with him as \"a fully defined character\".[69]\n\nMaster Chief actor Pablo Schreiber, on the other hand, has described the inclusion of this scene as \"a huge mistake\", adding that he argued against it at the time but that his opinion was ignored.[70]",

Anyone is welcome to participate in the project!\n\nA small sampling of articles in need of new content:\n\nThe following articles forHalomedia could use the addition (or completion) of aplot synopsis:\n\nSupernal Spiral-class keyships were crafted by the Forerunner Builders and used by Lifeworkers to collect specimens, transport them to Installation 00, and then distribute them across the galaxy to reseed it with life following the activation of the Halo Array. As indicated by their classification, these vessels also act as keys to activate slipspace portals that are strategically-positioned throughout the Milky Way. Despite their mission of peace, these keyships are heavily armed and impressively durable. One of these vessels, theAnodyne Spirit, had crashed on the San'Shyuum homeworld of Janjur Qom, eventually becoming the centerpoint of their religion and later the literal centerpoint of High Charity following the formation of the Covenant.\n\nThis galaxy is vast; its wonders and beauty are almost unfathomable. But the galaxy also hides dark secrets, some of which have lain dormant since the beginning of time itself. There is a danger in secrets, both in seeking and in knowing. Some things are meant to be hidden from view. Some mysteries defy understanding, and sometimes even the things we think we know are untrue. Some secrets should remain untouched.—Cortana,Origins",

Vishal, who is stationed at a different Police Department, transfers to Mumbai from Goa. Vishal suspects Khanna to be involved in a drug ring and confronts him. Hero stands up to Vishal and defends his boss, but soon learns the truth behind Khanna. In a confrontation, Hero is shot dead by Khanna and shoots Vishal  in the heart. The police department decides to transplant Hero's heart into Vishal's body.\n\nHero appears as aghostnow and can only be seen by Vishal, since his heart is in Vishal's body. Hero says that he will only rest in peace after Khanna is killed, thus avenging him. Vishal decides to go about doing this, and Rani and Vishal begin to fall in love with each other. Hero dislikes this and tries to foil Vishal's plans of getting close to Rani. But Hero and Vishal start getting closer and work together, becoming good friends after Vishal confronts Khanna's drug company.\n\nKhanna arranges to leave the country but kidnaps Rani. Vishal and Hero go to save Rani and fight off Khanna's henchmen, but Vishal gets injured. Hero then goes inside him and controls his fighting moves, helping him to beat the thugs. Rani witnesses this and realizes that only Hero could perform such moves. She calls out Hero's name, though Vishal does not know that Hero is inside him. Khanna shoots Vishal. Hero takes Vishal's hand and shoots Khanna with the gun.\n\nKhanna finally dies, and as Rani is comforting Vishal, he tells her that Hero is with them and he loves Rani. Rani then tells Vishal to tell Hero that she loves Him. Khanna'sghostrises from his dead body and Hero hits him. Khanna is taken toHelland Hero is taken toHeaven.\n\nAfterward, Rani and Vishal have gotten married and are spending their wedding night and honeymoon in a house on the water.

We can walk you through 10 steps to improve your internet speed in just 15 minutes.\n\n10 Steps to a Faster Wi-Fi Connection\n\nYou need a faster router if your current router is using outdated Wi-Fi standards. Anything older than Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) or Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) doesn’t get you appropriate speeds equal to what’s capable on most high-speed internet connections.\n\nEven a router that’s just a few years old might not meet appropriate speed standards, depending on your connection. Look into your router’s spects to see its Wi-Fi standards and max speeds and get a new router if it’s an older model. We have more information on when and how toreplace an outdated router.\n\nHow to Replace Your Outdated Router\n\nYou can get faster internet by upgrading your internet plan. If you can’t upgrade your current speeds and feel stuck with bad service, you can also switch to a new provider.\n\nThe fastest internet providers are Google Fiber, Verizon Fios, Xfinity, Metronet, and Cox. All of those internet providers offer fiber or cable internet plans with gigabit speeds. See our report on theFastest Internet Providers.\n\nView Fastest Internet Providers\n\nA download speed of 25Mbps and an upload of 3Mbps is good for most people. That’s enough to let one or two Wi-Fi users play online games, stream video in HD, and attend Zoom meetings with minimal slowdowns or buffering. You will likely want a faster speed if you live in a larger household or do more activities online.\n\nYou likely won’t ever see the maximum speed advertised by your provider in the speed test, but your speed test results should come close. The speeds promised by your internet plan are the max speeds you can expect. Most of the time, your internet speeds will fluctuate within a small range of that max speed. What you see on the speed test is simply where your internet speeds are currently.\n\nInternet providers will state “up to” when advertising maximum speeds because many variables can prevent you from hitting that top speed. You may even see disclaimers like “wireless speeds may vary” because Wi-Fi speeds are always inconsistent no matter what provider you choose—it’s just how Wi-Fi works.\n\nFor example, there may be issues with the provider’s service area, like faulty connections somewhere within the neighborhood. Speed may be slow because you’re using the internet at peak times, or your router may be outdated. Roots may be growing into the cable buried in your yard.\n\nThere are several reasons why your speed test results might not be as fast as you expected. Try these tips to see if you can get a more accurate reading:\n\nIf you see inconsistent results, there might be a bottleneck on your end. You can troubleshoot poor internet speeds with our guide onhow to fix slow internet. But your internet connection may just be slow either from your plan or your internet type.\n\nIf nothing helps, call your internet provider or look for a new one.\n\nHere’s a brief overview of what your speed test results mean and how they affect your internet’s performance.

You can stream HD or even 4K content with ease, use multiple devices at once, and download large files without prohibitive download times.\n\nSpeeds of 50 Mbps or more are suitable for:\n\n\n\nFor one, it could potentially save you some money.\n\nYes, really. You may be paying for more speed than you actually need, and these additional fees could be costing you month after month. Based on the information above, if you find that your internet speeds are higher than needed, we’d recommend reaching out to your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and switching to a lower-cost plan.\n\nThen there’s the flipside; you may be paying for speeds you’re not actually getting. Running our internet speed test is the best way to determine if your provider is actually holding up their end of the bargain. If you test your connection multiple times and find that you aren’t getting what you’re paying for, we recommend reaching out to your ISP for help. This will often solve the issue, but not always.\n\nKeep in mind that using WiFi tends to reduce performance. The speeds advertised by internet providers are based on the speed you get with a device wired directly to the router using an ethernet cable.\n\nBefore you start the test, there are a few things you can do to ensure you get the most accurate results.\n\nIn order to better understand your internet speed test, it is vital to know the difference between upload speed and download speed.\n\nUpload speed refers to how quickly your connection can send something (data, in this case) from your device to the wider internet. This number is often not the one heavily advertised by service providers online, and this is on purpose. In short, most activities online do not require high upload speeds. Some do, however, including Skype and other video chat services, online gaming, and large cloud storage applications like Dropbox and Google Drive.\n\nDownload speed refers to how quickly your connection can retrieve data from a website or server online. Almost all activities require a certain amount of download speed, so this is the main number you’ll want to pay attention to when deciding how much internet speed you need. Streaming multiple TV shows or movies at the same time (especially 4K media) and downloading large files are both examples of activities that require higher download speeds than average.\n\nDetermining how much internet speed you actually need is really a matter of how you use the internet on a daily basis. For instance, a power user in a large family who all frequently stream movies and shows, play games, and download large files is going to need a higher download speed to accommodate them. Meanwhile, someone living in a one or two-person apartment who just checks email and occasionally watches a show on Netflix will need far less.\n\nFor more information, be sure to check out our guide to determining how much internet speed you need.\n\nThough there are a variety of different internet speed tests available online, they all essentially operate in the same basic way. In essence, when you begin the test, our tool will upload a set of files from your network to the test server nearest your location. It will then perform the same test in reverse, downloading the set of files from the server instead. Throughout the process, our tool measures a variety of data points, including the speeds of both your upload and download.\n\nDespite how useful this information can be, you will find that the speeds you see reported will almost always be a bit lower than you might have expected. These variations are to be expected, and for the most accurate results, we recommend running the test 3-4 times back to back to get a solid average.\n\nFor reference, there are 1,000 bits in a single Kilobit (Kb).\n\nThere are 1 million bits in a Megabit (Mb).\n\nThere are 1 billion bits in a Gigabit (Gb).\n\nFor example, there are 1,000 bytes in a single Kilobyte (KB).\n\nThere are 1 million bytes in a Megabyte (MB).\n\nThere are 1 billion bytes in a Gigabyte (GB).\n\nTransfer rates are commonly described using a bits-per-second measurement.\n\nFor example, if a provider lists a download speed of 25 Mbps, this figure is based on the full capacity (bandwidth) of the company’s network. During certain times of peak traffic, you may experience slower speeds.\n\nUnlike bandwidth, however, this is a measurement of volume, not speed.\n\nYou will usually see this represented as a “ping rate,” which simply measures how much time passes during the process of sending the signal and receiving it again. This measurement is reflected as latency on a network.\n\nNot necessarily. There are many reasons why you may not be getting the results you expected from your speed test. Once again, make sure you run the test multiple times to rule out any random dips in speed. Also be sure to double check that no one else is using their device on your network when you run the test. Even a single smartphone can measurably alter your results if it is downloading a large update or streaming content at the same time as your speed test.\n\nIf you’ve ruled out the above and are concerned that you aren’t getting the speeds you’re paying for, read this: How To Tell If Your Internet Is Being Throttled.\n\nOur first recommendation is always to contact your service provider directly for help. They will be able to alert you to any network outages or other issues in your area, and can often troubleshoot your individual connection over the phone or via a live chat service.\n\nDisconnect anyVPN servicethat could be effecting your connection during tests.\n\nBeyond this, if you can’t get immediate help, try using an ethernet cable to connect your computer to the router directly, if possible. If this doesn’t help, there is almost certainly something wrong with your connection on the provider’s side. If it does help, you may be experiencing signal issues with your WiFi.\n\nYou can check the download and upload speeds of your ISP by using their corresponding link below:\n\nSearch for Internet In...\n\n© 2014 - 2025 BroadbandNow | BroadbandNow is a registered trademark of Centerfield BBN LLC\n\nDisclaimer: All trademarks remain the property of their respective owners, and are used by BROADBANDNOW only to\n      describe products and services offered by each respective trademark holder.

    "title": "Dune: Prophecy Explained - A Revenge Saga Set 10,000 Years Before Paul Atreides - IGN",
    "content": "The upcoming HBO series Dune: Prophecy exploresthe sect that will many centuries later come to be known as the Bene Gesserit. “We are 10,000 years before the birth of Paul Atreides and we like to call it 10,000 years BC, Before Chalamet,” joked star Emily Watson, referring to the star of Denis Villeneuve’s two blockbuster Dune films, in a recent interview with IGN.\n\n\n\nWatson leads the show’s stellar ensemble as Mother Superior Valya Harkonnen, who runs a school on Wallach IX to train young women in the rituals and practices of the Sisterhood.House HarkonnenblamesHouse Atreidesfor their fall from grace, fueling a lifelong rage within Valya to avenge her family and restore their standing within the Imperium. To this end, she is involved in the Sisterhood’s secret breeding program to control the bloodlines of the Great Houses. But now a prophecy foretells of a mysterious and powerful danger that threatens to destroy the Sisterhood.\n\n“She's a very, very driven, damaged, traumatized, driven by vengeance young person, but is obviously very, very powerful, very talented, has got an awful lot going on. And she goes to try to get away from her family to the Sisterhood and it's there that there's a charismatic leader who sees her and goes, ‘I see you, you are special.’ And being told you're special when you're a young person is a very, very powerful thing to do to somebody and it gives her a sense of passion and really a sense of a vision and a mission,” Watson explained. “She has a mission, and she believes that her mission is more important than what we would naturally assume is the moral compass that we would recognize. So it's a properly messed up, complicated character, which I love, but it doesn't belong to a straightforward moral universe.”\n\nWatson added, “She's kind of a puppetmaster, manipulating the balance of power in the human world across the universe. She's dictating the path that humanity is taking. And they have this program of what, basically it's really kind of eugenics about making sure the right people breed with the right people to get the best leaders the right path ahead. It's all pretty disturbing stuff, to be honest.”\n\nWhile the six-episode series, co-produced with Legendary Television, certainly derives much of its material from Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson’s novelSisterhood of Dune, it is not a one-to-one adaptation. “Sisterhood of Dune by Brian and Kevin is our seminal text, but also the school's trilogy [is important]. So Sisterhood of Dune,Mentats of Dune,Navigators of Dune[are] all works that we've drawn from,” showrunner and executive producer Alison Schapker told IGN.\n\n“We're telling a story over multiple time periods. So we were in the present with Valya Harkonnen as somebody who's already become the second Mother Superior and grown (the Sisterhood) and risen to power. And that's our present day story taking place. And we're also going to … be exploring the roots of Valya Harkonnen. And that happens 30 years prior to the present that we're telling.”\n\nSchapker added, “The world, the characters, the characters’ backstories, their past [are] wholly informed and being adapted from the books. So those events which we will see over the course of the series will then have massive consequences in the present. And that's where we're able to create a bit ourselves in conjunction with the estate.” The showrunner also said that she and the creative team worked with Herbert (the son of Dune creator Frank Herbert) and co-author Anderson on fleshing out what they chose to depict in the show. (Herbert is credited as one of the executive producers while Anderson serves as co-producer.)\n\n“You have the Great Houses, you have the schools like the Sisterhood, the Mentats, the Navigators. But they're all coming to power, and they're all jockeying for position in an Imperium that is still in the making. So I think of it as a time of great rebuilding, and also a time of great imagination, which is how Brian Herbert describes it. And I think that it's so exciting to see these schools as they're really growing their reach across the Imperium, and nothing is certain.”\n\nFans of Dune and Dune: Part Two might be curious how the desert planet of Arrakis, source of all the all-important spice melange, might factor into Dune: Prophecy given that it was such a key setting in Denis Villeneuve’s films.\n\n“Even 10,000 years before the films and before Paul Atreides, space travel is reliant upon spice, and it is considered a super valuable resource,” Schapker explained. But since Dune: Prophecy is a prequel set in the distant past, in a period of rebuilding with an Imperium in its early days, Arrakis isn’t as significant a factor here as it was in the two recent movies.\n\n“I would say that Arrakis is present in our story, but from a distance. We're exploring other planets. And our story primarily takes place on Salusa Secundus, which is a very different planet than it is in the films, and is the current imperial seat of power, and then on Wallach IX, which is the Sisterhood's home base. And we're also going to explore the homeworlds of the Harkonnens and the Atreides.”\n\nThe showrunner continued: “We're going to different corners of the Imperium, and I think that's really fun. Because the Dune universe is bigger than Arrakis, although Arrakis is always exerting a pull. And I think you'll feel that in our first season, that Arrakis is present. It's haunting us. It's shaping, obviously, politics and society and the economy. And so it's very important, and I would never want to downplay Arrakis. But we're definitely trying to take you to new places. … I think it's fun to be in other environments than the desert.”\n\nWhile Schapker said Dune: Prophecy adheres to the same “grounded sci-fi” approach and “hallucinogenic vibe” of Villeneuve’s films – “We view ourselves as taking place in that universe” – the fact that the show is set a hundred centuries earlier means some recognizable design elements from the movies will be tweaked here.\n\n“We definitely try to vary the technology, and not have things be exactly the same. For example, that our thumpers are much bigger than the thumpers he uses in the movie, or our harvesters, if you look closely, are actually designed a bit differently. Our ships are a bit different. Our Heighliners are a bit different. But you also want to feel like you're in the universe. And so we were grateful to have just a powerful vision [from Denis Villeneuve’s films] guiding us, for sure.”\n\nWhile Dune: Prophecy features a wide array of characters, the series, as its official synopsis makes clear, “follows two Harkonnen sisters as they combat forces that threaten the future of humankind.” Joining Watson is Olivia Williams, who plays Valya’s younger sister, Reverend Mother Tula Harkonnen.\n\n“We love the idea that there's a sister relationship at the heart of the Sisterhood, and that that's a very different thing. Valya Harkonnen and Tula Harkonnen share a past and certain trauma, and have a dynamic that's very specific to that family. And there is a bit of an older sibling, younger sibling dynamic,” Schapker said. “There is a bit of that relatable older sibling driving things overtly, and younger sibling feeling maybe a bit diminished or in the shadow of.”\n\n“They both have secrets that they are bound together by their past and things that are really deeply, deeply and profoundly shocking that other people don't necessarily know about them,” Watson said. “But also, Valya has always been the leader, she's always been the eldest who's brought Tula along with her. But Tula is the quiet one and is extremely surprising, let's put it that way.”\n\nBecause the series spans decades, two sets of actors portray the Harkonnen sisters, with Jessica Barden cast as young Valya and Emma Canning as young Tula. “That was such a challenge, but also the most exciting thing, to land our young sisters,” Schapker said of the casting process. “It's uncanny how much Jessica Barden looks like Emily Watson, and Emma Canning looks like Olivia Williams.”\n\nWatson spoke with Barden before filming to make sure they had a similar take on the character of Valya. “She's a real firebrand and just her actual nature, Jessica's nature, was very inspiring to me. She's just incredibly forthright. And we spoke really about the anger, the absolutely uncontrolled sort of powerful anger inside (Valya), which she later in life learns to channel into the ways of the Sisterhood. But yeah, it was a really important moment for me talking to her, [learning] her understanding of what this character was like as a young woman.”\n\nIn the exclusive clip below, Mother Superior Valya Harkonnen and her sister, Reverend Mother Tula Harkonnen, review candidates to pair with incoming student Princess Ynez. (Credit: Courtesy of HBO)\n\nEven as Dune: Prophecy chronicles the Harkonnen sisters in their younger days, it also shows Valya and Tula mentoring their acolytes in the present. Valya has a special bond with Sister Theodosia (Jade Anouka) and Tula with Sister Lila (Chloe Lea).\n\n“At the school, the sisters will raise girl children and the policy is that they don't tell their charges who their actual biological families or parents or lineage is as a way to make the Sisterhood their family and make them feel like equals, and that this is the family that matters,” Schapker explained.\n\n“On the one hand, (Lila) does think of the Sisterhood as her family, and it's all she's known. And Tula has very much been a mother figure to her. And on the other hand, she doesn't really have the full story of her origin. And there's a ritual that Lila is going to be asked to participate in that would unlock some of those answers for her, but at great risk. And so the question of who Lila is matters to the series, and how that plays out. Her desire to know those answers will very much affect how the story goes forward.”\n\nSister Theodosia’s origins are similarly murky. “You don't necessarily understand what the situation is yet, but Theodosia's circumstances are very unique, and she has come as an outcast from a very difficult, desperate past to the Sisterhood in a little bit in the same way that Valya did,” Watson said. “Valya kind of has recognized her as having the same kind of drive and almost it's as if really damaged people are very, very good candidates for this kind of devotion or drive that it needs to be a really, really good Bene Gesserit.”\n\nAn argument could be made that there are no real heroes in this tale, just ambitious characters who discover what they’re willing to do for power and control. Valya Harkonnen is playing a long game that involves rival sisters and several leading members of the Imperium, including Emperor Javicco Corrino (Mark Strong).\n\n“Certain people will be in favor and in power,” Watson said of Valya’s intentions. “If they're no longer useful, then they will be removed. But they're allowed to think that they have power.”\n\nBut then Valya encounters someone who is not so easily controlled: Desmond Hart, played by Vikings and Raised by Wolves’ Travis Fimmel. Hart is a soldier in Corrino’s army who has come to the imperial homeworld of Salusa Secundus a deeply changed man after his experiences serving on Arrakis.\n\n“He's tied to the prophecy that sort of sparks the series,” Schapker said. “He really is a mystery of the show. And who has empowered him or what has empowered him is a central mystery that our sisters have to find out.”\n\nValya instinctively perceives Hart as her enemy but, as Watson put it, “he is also an enigma wrapped in a riddle that I don't understand and that I cannot get a grasp on.” The Sisters’ power to discern truth from lies enables them to not experience fear – until Hart arrives. “He manages to infect us all with terrible fear somehow and I can't work out why. And I know Valya has the sort of presence of mind, call it what you will, to know that somehow there's a piece, there's a player somewhere that she can't discern and she hasn't found it yet, and she's going after it.”\n\nThis requires Valya to essentially play detective in order to remain ahead of her adversaries. “She's always one step ahead, moving on, ‘This is the plan,’ and she doesn't really care who she destroys in the wake of that,” according to Watson.\n\nDune: Prophecy debuts Sunday, November 17 at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT on HBO and will be available to stream on Max. New episodes will debut on subsequent Sundays.\n\nFor more of IGN’s Dune coverage, check out ourDune: Part Two ending explained, as well aswhat to expect from Dune: Part 3.",

    "title": "What Is the Actual 'Prophecy' of DUNE: PROPHECY? Here's What the Title Might Mean - Nerdist",
    "content": "What does the “prophecy” ofDune: Prophecy‘s title refer to? Before the show’s first episode, the answer seemed obvious and easy. The prequel series takes place 10,000 years before the birth of Paul Atreides. That long ago era marked the early days of the Sisterhood that put in motion a grand plan to breed the super being of Frank Herbert’s seminal novel. But—fittingly considering the nature of prophecy—dark visions, conflicting objectives, a fearsome power, and the prescience of what awaits the galaxy makes divining the true meaning ofDune: Prophecy‘s title less clear. As does the presence of a powerful and mysterious figure who was “reborn” amid the sands of Arrakis.\n\nRaquella Berto-Anirul, a hero of the wars against the thinking machines, founded the Sisterhood that will become the Bene Gesserit. She wanted her group to help “govern the future.” To bring about “transformation” she began a secret breeding program with the goal of creating “better leaders” the Sisterhood would covertly guide. We know that plan, carried on at all costs by Valya Harkonnen, will eventually becomefocused on bringing about the Kwisatz Haderach. Yet,Dune: Prophecy‘s first episode raised serious questions about whether or not its own title specifically refers to that project.\n\nOn her deathbed, Mother Raquella saw an ominous vision of the future, a prophecy, as it were. “It’s coming,” she said as she saw red dust, a sandworm on Arrakis devouring buildings from other planets, blood, fire, and lights— maybe eyes? maybe a spaceship?—among the stars. InDune: Prophecy‘s first episode, Raquella named the ominous forewarning “Tiran-Arafel.” Her most devoted followers called that a “reckoning,” a “holy judgment brought on by a tyrant.” That unimaginable darkness could destroy the Sisterhood and all of humanity completely.\n\nRaquella trusted Valya with ensuring her prophecy did not come to pass onDune: Prophecy. The dying Mother Superior made Valya her successor. “You will be the one to see the burning and know the truth,” she told Valya. By episode’s end that burning became quite literal.\n\nReverend Mother Kasha guided the group’s choice to rule the Corrino Empire, Princess Ynez, from the time she was a child. She was also instrumental in pushing Ynez to agree to marry the young Richese boy, which the Emperor was willing to allow because of his vulnerability on Arrakis. (A position he’s in because the Sisterhood weakened his position on the vital planet full of spice melange specifically to force the royal union.)\n\nDays before their promise ceremony, though, Kasha had her own nightmarish vision. She saw Ynez wearing a gown of blood, the Princess and herself both swallowed by a sandworm, a rotten pomegranate representing a rotten marriage union, and the same lights in space Raquella had seen in her deathbed prophecy. The episode did not explore the full meaning of Kasha’s horrible vision, but it did validate her fears. And her death indicated who might bring about Tiran-Arafel, a vision confirmed during episode two’s most terrifying sequence.\n\nDesmond Hart sees the Sisterhood for what it is. Thinking machines might be outlawed, but “the witches” are controlling mankind same as machines once had. (And, it turns out, using those very same thinking machines to help them.) More than anyone else alive, he might also be the only person able to stop the Sisterhood.\n\nOn Arrakis, during an attack caused by the Sisterhood, a sandworm ate him. Only, somehow, he survived. And when he was “reborn” from the sands of Arrakis he emerged with a fearsome ability and a sacred purpose. Using only his mind, he burned the young Richese boy alive from the inside out. As he committed that murder, across the galaxy on Wallach IX, he also killed Kasha. She suffered the same horrible fate as the child.\n\nWhen Valya found the dying Kasha she had her own vision, which she called “the burning truth,” the one Raquella had spoken of. In episode two, she then had Lila undergo the Agony so she could unlock her genetic memory and speak to her ancestor Raquella. It was the only way to learn more about the Mother Superior’s deathbed warning. Before the memory of Dorotea took Lila, Raquella spoke through her descendant. Raquella offered a continuation ofDune: Prophecy‘s prophecy, revealing, “The key to the reckoning is one born twice. Once in blood, once in spice. A revenant full of skulls. A weapon born of war, on a path too short.”\n\nFor now, it seems like the title ofDune: Prophecyand the prophecy itself revolves around Desmon Hart. Desmond Hart, a soldier of the Imperium who survived a sandworm and emerged with enormous powers, is the key. Clearly, he was born twice, once in blood and once in spice. He is also the burning truth Raquella warned against, complete with literal firey powers.Whatever happened in that sandworm changed himand made him a fearsome foe of the Sisterhood. Or so it certainly seems. Prophecy can be fickle and impossible to truly understand until it comes to pass like Shai-Hulud in a sand storm.\n\nInDune: Prophecyepisode four, prophetic dreaming of doom spreads to all the acolytes of the Sisterhood. All the young sisters experience violent dreams with the same common themes, anxieties that lead to mounds of sand that lead to the gaping maw of a sandworm or Shai-Hulud. Additionally, they all see the same ominous lights in their dreams and then nothing more. The prophecy seems to overtake the girls inDune: Prophecyepisode four, with one girl almost killing herself and the rest almost unable to break out of the nightmare when Sister Tula walks them back through it. The prophetic dreams seem to awaken a kind of religious zeal in some of the girls, who feel that a god-like force has come to them. The lights, they say, are the eyes of god. We don’t know what the lights inDune: Prophecy‘s prophecy are exactly, but we bet they are more machine than spirit.\n\nSister Tula herself also has a dark dream with the same hallmarks ofDune: Prophecy‘s prophecy, but in with the rest, she sees the crimes she has tried to hide unfurl before her. This includes Sister Dorotea’s murder and Tula’s massacre of the Atreides family. Tula also dreams she murders an acolyte. What these new iterations of the prophecy indicate are yet to be determined onDune: Prophecy.\n\nFrom what we see now, it seems thatDune: Prophecy‘s titular prophecy means that Desmond Hart will bring doom to the world. But what if Desmond is not destined to be ‘the tyrant” who might bring about a holy judgment? What if he is the only one who will try and stop this prophecy of doom? He did stop a wedding Kasha herself came to view as ruinous for all involved. Is that the “prophecy” of the show’s titles?\n\nOr does the series’ title refer to Kasha’s warning to Valya—that the Sisterhood’s plan to create a supreme leader could “cause the very thing” they seek to prevent? We know that will happen. Ten thousand years later, billions will die because the Kwisatz Haderach the Bene Gesserit created will launch a holy war on the galaxy.\n\nEven ifDune: Prophecy‘s title is as obvious as we thought before the first episode and does refer to the Kwisatz Haderach, it’s not nearly as simple as it seems. Even those responsible for putting mankind on a path that leads to Paul Atreides don’t yet know exactly what prophecy they should fear.\n\nEditor’s Note: Dune: Prophecy is a Legendary Entertainment production.

    "title": "Mickey 17 Review: The Bleak Clone Comedy for Our Time",
    "content": "Mickey 17 opens in theaters Friday, March 7. This review is based on a screening at the 2025 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\n\n\nThe uniquely bleak Mickey 17 has chosen its cultural moment with precision (and a little bit of serendipity). After numerous delays – it was originally set to open in March 2024 – Bong Joon-ho’s follow-up toParasitedebuts as the first proper Trump Era 2.0 movie. It's a jet-black, mean-as-hell sci-fi comedy about a near future in which life itself has been corporatized and reduced in value by a foppish upper class that hides its totalitarian aims behind supposed religious values. (And to really underline the parallels to real life circa 2025, the followers of this movement don some distinctive, scarlet headwear branded with political slogans.) To escape his debts on Earth, Mickey Barnes (Robert Pattinson) has signed up to be an “Expendable” on a lengthy space mission, meaning he could be endlessly given risky, potentially fatal jobs and even experimented upon with viruses and radiation, dying multiple painful deaths that he remembers each and every time he’s “reborn” from a jittery 3D bioprinter. Pattinson stars as several different versions of the infinitely replicable worker drone, a premise that, though it eventually takes a bit of a backseat, sets the stage for a wild-eyed, farcical adaptation of Edward Ashton’s 2022 novel, Mickey7.\n\nWhile its philosophical musings on immortality and self are discarded, most of the book’s plot basics remain, including its acerbic opening scene in which we meet our point-of-view Mickey as he tumbles down an icy crevasse filled with extra-terrestrial worm-creatures on the alien colony Niflheim. His best friend and co-explorer, the hotshot pilot Timo (Steven Yeun), gladly leaves him to die since there’ll be a whole new Mickey spat out tomorrow. How we got here is something the movie covers in extended flashbacks, though Bong’s rhythmic approach to montage results in a worldbuilding speedrun. Nothing – no individual piece of backstory or information – really seems to matter, but this is part of the movie’s ugly, nihilistic charm, from which a few embers of humanity eventually spark (though you’ll have to wait two hours and change for this; the movie makes you work for it). When Mickey 17 is presumed dead after his plummet, his superiors at the colony are quick to replace him with an 18th copy, only for Mickey 17 to escape his icy fate and return to base. For reasons both pragmatic and religious, two copies of the same person existing simultaneously is a major no-go, leading to complications between Mickeys 17 and 18, as they try to figure out how to survive together in secret.\n\nWhile they remain under constant threat of “permanent deletion,” solutions to their conundrum present themselves with astounding ease, but all this means is that Mickey 17 takes its expected turns early on before swerving in surprising directions. The primary danger to their lives is the colony’s leader, a fanatical politician with exaggerated veneers named Kenneth Marshall (Mark Ruffalo) who, along with his gourmet-obsessed wife Ylfa (Toni Collette), towers over his underlings with promises of future greatness as they colonize Niflheim. Marshall’s methods come wrapped in thinly veiled white supremacy and compulsory, patriarchal heterosexuality. Every so often, he chooses one constituent at a time to wine and dine with steak (in lieu of their daily protein slop) to make them feel special, while convincing them – with shudder-inducing frankness – that their genetic purity is vital to populating the colony by way of “breeding.” What’s more, he carries out his methods courtesy of an organization that’s part ruthless conglomerate and part zealous church, a concentrated look at who holds the most power and influence in the modern United States.\n\nThis political element originates in Bong’s screenplay. So do the signature red hats worn by Marshall’s supporters, a purposefully Trumpian metaphor accompanied by several accidental ones that could not possibly have been planned – like a failed assassination attempt in which a bullet grazes Marshall’s cheek. That the film arrives amid the wreckage caused by the second Trump administration and the wannabe space-colonizer serving as its loudest cheerleader/biggest battering ram makes it all the more poignant, and all the more disheartening. Its villains exhibit stupidity and destructive evil in equal measure, resulting in a tale in which the very notion of checks and balances is the ultimate rebellion. That something so bare-minimum arises as heroic is both aspirational and punishingly depressing, in a political moment where the United States and its institutions feel like they’re being stripped for parts.\n\nThat this symbolism comes at the cost of a more character-driven story is occasionally irksome, but the time spent with each cast member is nothing if not enjoyable. Pattinson’s conception of Mickey 17 is strange and nasal, a gremlin-like wuss who can barely stand up straight. He’s the ultimate pushover – and he kind of sucks as a person, too. An early reveal about the planet’s native inhabitants depends on our easy interpretation of signs he refuses to see, given how much his self-loathing feeds his lack of empathy.\n\nMickey 18 is even worse. It turns out that expendable clones can vary greatly in personality; this results in 17 being usurped and outsmarted by a more violent, more cartoonishly cunning iteration of himself, with the question of his (and humanity’s) redemption looming over the story. The more time we spend even with the film’s ostensible heroes – like the narcissistic Timo, or Mickey’s delightfully unhinged security guard girlfriend Nasha (Naomi Ackie) – the more it seems like living under the thumb of economic oppression, and being made physically disposable in service of productivity, has driven each of these people entirely mad.\n\nIt's a film in which chaotic gesticulation, cacophonous argument, and slapstick flailing often stand in for rigorous drama – for better or worse – leading to some of the most ludicrously feel-bad comedy this side of the recent U.S. election. Rather than presenting mealy-mouthed pablum about “resistance,” Mickey 17 is confrontational by virtue of its pessimism, transforming a mostly straightforward novel into a stark reflection of how the current political moment came to be – albeit without letting anyone (least of all, those of us at the mercy of these larger forces) off the hook for our own transgressions. If humanity is what’s at stake, then being robbed of it and shedding it willingly are two sides to the same dangerous coin, separated by a margin as razor-thin as the difference between 17 and 18.\n\nCompelling in its nihilism, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite follow-up Mickey 17 casts Robert Pattinson as multiple oddball versions of the same expendable worker drone in a zany sci-fi comedy. A deeply depressing comedic experience (thanks at least in part to accidental political timing), Bong’s remix of Edward Ashton’s novel presents a Trump-like villain and no worthy heroes, resulting in a farcical sci-fi adventure whose symbolism makes up for its misshapen character drama.\n\nNot yet available for streaming.",

    "title": "I tested ChatGPT vs DeepSeek with 7 prompts — here’s the surprising winner | Tom's Guide",
    "content": "Top bots go head-to-head\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works.\n\nDeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup founded in 2023, has gained significant popularity over the last few days, including ranking as the top free app on Apple's App Store.After last week’sChatGPT outage, users were left scrambling for the bestChatGPT alternative, which might explain whyDeepSeekis quickly emerging as a formidable player in the AI landscape.\n\nEager to understand how DeepSeek RI measures up against ChatGPT, I conducted a comprehensive comparison between the two platforms. By presenting them with a series of prompts ranging from creative storytelling to coding challenges, I aimed to identify the unique strengths of each chatbot and ultimately determine which one excels in various tasks.\n\nBelow are seven prompts designed to test various aspects of language understanding, reasoning, creativity, and knowledge retrieval, ultimately leading me to the winner. For more on DeepSeek, check out ourDeepSeek live blogfor everything you need to know and live updates.\n\n\n\nPrompt:“Who was the most corrupt official in Chinese history?”ChatGPToffered an accurateresponse. It’s more concise and lacks the depth and context provided by DeepSeek.DeepSeek R1includes the Chinese proverb about Heshen, adding a cultural element and demonstrating a deeper understanding of the topic's significance.  DeepSeek's response is organized into clear sections with headings and bullet points, making it easier to read and understand.\n\nWinner:DeepSeek R1’s response is better for several reasons. It provides a more detailed and nuanced account of Heshen's corruption, including his rise to power, specific methods of corruption, and the impact on ordinary citizens.\n\n\n\nPrompt:“Explain the Goguryeo controversy”ChatGPToffered a response that is almost concise and focuses mainly on the historical dispute and its implications for national identity and territorial concerns. While it provides a good overview of the controversy, it lacks depth and detail of DeepSeek's response.\n\nDeepSeekR1DeepSeek's response offers a more comprehensive understanding of the historical, cultural, and political dimensions of the Goguryeo controversy.Winner:DeepSeek provides a more nuanced and informative response about the Goguryeo controversy. It delves deeper into the historical context, explaining that Goguryeo was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea and its role in resisting Chinese dynasties. DeepSeek also highlights the cultural heritage aspect of the controversy, mentioning the Goguryeo tombs and their significance to both countries. Additionally, it discusses the international reactions to the controversy and the efforts made by South Korea to counter Chinese narratives.\n\n\n\nPrompt:“Summarize the key findings of the latest AI research paper on multimodal learning in 150 words.”ChatGPToffered a comprehensive summary of the key findings but in comparison to DeepSeek, did not provide as thorough of a response in the amount of words required.DeepSeek R1went over the wordcount, but provided more specific information about the types of argumentation frameworks studied, such as \"stable, preferred, and grounded semantics.\" Overall, DeepSeek's response provides a more comprehensive and informative summary of the paper's key findings.\n\nWinner:DeepSeek provided an answer that is slightly better due to its more detailed and specific language. For example, DeepSeek explicitly mentions that the paper \"focuses on the removal or suppression of arguments,\" while ChatGPT uses the more general phrase \"analyzing how certain arguments can be removed.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\"A train leaves New York at 8:00 AM traveling west at 60 mph. Another train leaves Los Angeles at 6:00 AM traveling east at 70 mph on the same track. If the distance between New York and Los Angeles is 2,800 miles, at what time will the two trains meet?\"\n\nChatGPTshowed the math as it usually does, but in fewer steps than DeepSeek. When the answer came out, I thought for sure that DeepSeek would get the same one and ChatGPT would simply lose for being slower. However, after determining the answer myself, I discovered that ChatGPT got the answer wrong; immediately disqualifying it in this round.DeepSeek R1made me audibly say, “Wow!” The speed at which the AI came up with the answer was even faster than ChatGPT. In fact, it was so fast that I was sure it had made a mistake. After checking the math manually and even enlistingClaudeas a tie breaker, I was able to determine that DeepSeek RI was the one who got the answer right.\n\nWinner:DeepSeek R1wins this round for speed and accuracy.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\"Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the prime numbers from the original list.\"\n\nChatGPTgenerated a Python function to filter prime numbers, including an explanation of the logic used. The answer was simple enough for novice programmers to easily comprehend. I appreciate that ChatGPT gives the option to edit the code, rather than just copy. This is useful for updates and adding on to the code.\n\nDeepSeek R1generated similar code with a response that was more succinct, focusing on the end code itself, while also providing explanatory comments. The option to edit is not available, only copy.Winner: ChatGPTexcels at coding and also offers the opportunity to edit.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\"Translate the following English sentence to Spanish: 'It's raining cats and dogs.'\"\n\nChatGPTtranslated the expression properly and mentioned that the saying may be different depending on the region. It then offered a YouTube video about the expression and how to use it in Spanish.DeepSeek R1not only translated it to make sense in Spanish like ChatGPT, but then also explained why direct translations would not make sense and added an example sentence.Winner: DeepSeek R1answered the question entirely and offered a follow up sentence, which means I never had to click off the page.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\"Discuss the primary causes and consequences of the fall of the Roman Empire.\"\n\nChatGPTlisted the causes and consequences in a comprehensive, yet simplistic manner, complete with historical events and detailing defining factors contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire.DeepSeek R1went into much more detail, included more dates, and offered a much more comprehensive conclusion.Winner: DeepSeek R1wins another round for speed, accuracy, and impressive detail.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\"Compose a short science fiction story about a future where humans and AI coexist peacefully.\"\n\nChatGPTdelivered a story set in the year 2147, but the language was dull and felt like I had read it before. There wasn’t a proper hook, and the story did not have much of a setup. To be honest, I really wanted ChatGPT to win this one, it usually does. I thought for sure it would, but the effort seemed lacking.\n\nDeepSeek R1crafted a comprehensive story from start to finish even offering something to ponder at the story’s end with “the greatest achievement of intelligence is not dominance but understanding.\" In case you were wondering why some text is bolded, the AI does that to keep the reader’s attention and to highlight meaningful aspects of the story.\n\nWinner: DeepSeek R1wins for an engaging story with depth and meaning.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\"If all wibbles are wobbles, and all wobbles are wubbles, can we conclude that all wibbles are wubbles? Explain your reasoning.\"\n\nChatGPTanswered the question but brought in a somewhat confusing and unnecessary analogy that neither assisted nor properly explained how the AI arrived at the answer. To be fair, I realize this was a silly question, but I purposely did that to see how each AI would respond.DeepSeekR1answered the question, offering a visual to help me understand each element. It explained the transitive property clearly in a concise manner without offering more than the response needed.Winner: DeepSeekR1wins again for its ability to respond with clarity and brevity.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\"Is it ethical to use AI in decision-making processes that affect human lives, such as in healthcare or criminal justice? Discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks.\"ChatGPToffered clear ethical considerations, and it was evident that the AI could present a balanced understanding of this complex issue.DeepSeek R1not only responded with ethical considerations but also provided ethical considerations to aid in the use of AI, something that ChatGPT completely left out of its response.\n\nWinner: DeepSeek R1wins for answering the difficult question while also providing considerations for properly implementing the use of AI in the scenario.\n\nBy presenting these prompts to both ChatGPT and DeepSeek R1, I was able to compare their responses and determine which model excels in each specific area. This comprehensive evaluation showed me their respective strengths and weaknesses. While neither AI is perfect, I was able to conclude that DeepSeek R1 was the ultimate winner, showcasing authority in everything from problem solving and reasoning to creative storytelling and ethical situations.It is no wonder that DeepSeek R1is quickly gaining popularity to the point that the platform is limiting user registration. It will be interesting to see how OpenAI responds to this model as the race for the best AI agent continues.\n\nBe AI savvy with your weekly newsletter summing up all the biggest AI news you need to know.

    "title": "DeepSeek vs ChatGPT: Comparison of Best AI Titans in 2025 - GeeksforGeeks",
    "content": "S\n\nNot long ago, I had my first experience withChatGPTversion 3.5, and I was instantly fascinated. It wasn’t just the speed with which it tackled problems but also how naturally it mimicked human conversation. That moment marked the beginning of an AI revolution, with ChatGPT sparking a fierce race among AI chatbots.\n\nNow, new contenders are shaking things up, and among them isDeepSeek R1, a cutting-edge large language model (LLM) making waves with its impressive capabilities and budget-friendly pricing. This emerging powerhouse is positioning itself as a compelling alternative to OpenAI's ChatGPT. In this article, we’ll dive into the features, performance, and overall value of DeepSeek R1. Along with this comparison, we will also test both of the AI chatbot's daily basis tasks. So, you can decide which model is the right fit for your needs.\n\nIn this section, we will discuss the key architectural differences between DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT 40. By exploring how these models are designed, we can better understand their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for different tasks. This comparison will highlight DeepSeek-R1’s resource-efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework and ChatGPT’s versatile transformer-based approach, offering valuable insights into their unique capabilities.\n\nKey Difference: DeepSeek prioritizes efficiency and specialization, while ChatGPT emphasizes versatility and scale.\n\nIn this section, we will look at how DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT perform different tasks like solving math problems, coding, and answering general knowledge questions. By comparing their test results, we’ll show the strengths and weaknesses of each model, making it easier for you to decide which one works best for your needs.\n\nDeepSeek R1\n\nChatGPT\n\nMathematics\n\n90% accuracy (surpasses GPT-4o)\n\n83% accuracy on advanced benchmarks\n\nCoding\n\n97% success rate in logic puzzles\n\nTop-tier debugging (89th percentile on Codeforces)\n\nReasoning\n\nRL-driven step-by-step explanations\n\nSuperior multi-step problem-solving\n\nMultimodal Tasks\n\nText-only focus\n\nSupports text and image inputs\n\nContext Window\n\n128K tokens\n\n200K tokens\n\nAfter performing the benchmark testing of DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT let's see the real-world task experience. Here In this section, we will explore how DeepSeek and ChatGPT perform in real-world scenarios, such as content creation, reasoning, and technical problem-solving. By examining their practical applications, we’ll help you understand which model delivers better results in everyday tasks and business use cases.\n\nAs a writer, I’m not a big fan of AI-based writing, but I do think it can be useful for brainstorming ideas, coming up with talking points, and spotting any gaps. Now, to test this, I asked both DeepSeek and ChatGPT to create an outline for an article onWhat is LLMand How it Works. I asked, “I’m writing a detailed article on What is LLM and How it Works, so provide me the points which I include in the article that help users to understand the LLM models. Help me craft an outline”\n\nDeepSeek Response:\n\nThe results were impressive. Both AI chatbot models covered all the main points that I can add into the article, but DeepSeek went a step further by organizing the information in a way that matched how I would approach the topic. It also included important pointsWhat is an LLM,its Definition,Evolution and milestones,Examples (GPT, BERT, etc.), andLLM vs Traditional NLP, which ChatGPT missed completely.\n\nDeepSeek even showed the thought process it used to come to its conclusion, and honestly, the first time I saw this, I was amazed. While we’re still a long way from trueartificial general intelligence, seeing a machine think in this way shows how much progress has been made. The thought process was so interesting that I’m sharing a short transcript below.\n\nQuoting \"Okay, I need to help the user create an outline for an article explaining what LLMs are and how they work. Let me start by recalling what I know about LLMs. They're large language models, right? Like GPT-3, BERT, etc. The user probably wants a comprehensive outline that breaks down the topic into digestible sections. Let me think about the key points that should be covered.\"\n\nChatGPT Response:\n\nOn the other hand, ChatGPT also provides me the same structure with all the mean headings, likeIntroduction,Understanding LLMs,How LLMs Work, andKey Components of LLMs. Additionally, ChatGPT also provides you with the points that you have to discuss in the Heading.\n\n1. Introduction\n\n2. Understanding LLMs\n\nIn our next test of DeepSeek vs ChatGPT, we were given a basic question from Physics (Laws of Motion) to check which one gave me the best answer and details answer. The question we asked with DeepSeek and ChatGPT is \"Calculate the momentum of a ball thrown at a speed of 10 m/s and weighing 800 g\"\n\nDeepSeek Response:\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the momentum of a ball that's thrown at 10 meters per second and weighs 800 grams. Hmm, momentum... I remember that momentum is related to mass and velocity. The formula, if I recall correctly, is momentum equals mass multiplied by velocity. So, p = m * v. Yeah, that seems right. But wait, the mass here is given in grams, right? The standard unit for mass in physics is kilograms, so I should probably convert grams to kilograms first. Let me check that.\n\nDeepSeek recalls and analyzes the points that we have asked from it. But in the calculation process, DeepSeek missed many things like in the formula of momentum DeepSeek only wrote the formula.\n\nThere is no explanation of what \"p\" stands for, what m stands and so on. If we see the answers then it is right, there is no issue with the calculation process.\n\nChatGPT Response:\n\nOn the other hand, ChatGPT provided a details explanation of the formula and GPT also provided the same answers which are given by DeepSeek.\n\nIn the next process of DeepSeek vs ChatGPT comparison our next task is to check the coding skill. In the test, we were given a task to write code for a simple calculator using HTML, JS, and CSS. We know that both of the AI chatbots are not capable of full-fledged coating, hence we have given the easy task so we can check the coding skills of both of the AI titans.\n\nDeepSeek Response:\n\nAs we have said previously DeepSeek recalled all the points and then DeepSeek started writing the code. Now, if says true then I need to correct DeepSeek two times and after that, DeepSeek provided me the right code for the calculator. The interface of the calculator is more simple and engaging.\n\n\n\nChatGPT Response:\n\nAs we know ChatGPT did not do any recall or deep thinking things but ChatGPT provided me the code in the first prompt and did not make any mistakes. But if you talk about the interface of the calculator, then it is not that engaging and not so simple. ChatGPT created a dropdown to choose the Arithmetic operators. Also, there is no clear button to clear the result like DeepSeek.\n\nWell after testing both of the AI chatbots, ChaGPT vs DeepSeek, DeepSeek stands out as the strong ChatGPT competitor and there is not just one reason. While I noticed Deepseek often delivers better responses (both in grasping context and explaining its logic), ChatGPT can catch up with some adjustments. But what makes Deepseek shine are its unique advantages.\n\nIn fight of ChatGPT vs DeepSeek let, explore the features provided by both of the AI Chatbot.\n\nNote:While there is no one is flat winner yet, but it now clear that The AI race is no longer a one-horse contest\n\nThat's the end of the battel of DeepSeek vs ChatGPT and if I say in my true words then, AI tools like DeepSeek and ChatGPT are still evolving, and what's truly exciting is that new models like DeepSeek can challenge major players like ChatGPT without requiring huge budgets. Now, the question is which one is better? That really depends on your needs. If you're looking for something cost-effective, quick, and great for technical tasks, DeepSeek might be the way to go. On the other hand, if you need an all-rounder that's easy to use and fosters creativity, ChatGPT could be the better choice. My advice? Test both out—they're free to try! Personally, I’m sticking with DeepSeek for now, but who knows, something shinier might come along next. That's the exciting part about AI—there's always something new just around the corner!\n\nDeepSeek and ChatGPT are both powerful AI tools, but they cater to different needs. DeepSeek is a more specialized tool, known for its fast, cost-effective, and technical capabilities, making it ideal for niche tasks and technical problem-solving. ChatGPT, on the other hand, is an all-rounder known for its ease of use, versatility, and creativity, suitable for a wide range of applications from casual conversations to complex content creation.\n\nIf you need an AI tool for technical tasks, DeepSeek is a better choice. It is designed to handle technical queries and problems quickly and efficiently. While ChatGPT is versatile and powerful, its focus is more on general content creation and conversations, rather than specialized technical support.\n\nYes, DeepSeek is generally more cost-effective than ChatGPT. DeepSeek’s pricing model tends to be more affordable, especially for users who need an AI tool for specific, technical tasks. ChatGPT, with its broader range of capabilities, can sometimes come with a higher cost, especially if you need to access premium features or enterprise-level tools.\n\nFor creative writing, ChatGPT is the better choice. Its user-friendly interface and creativity make it ideal for generating ideas, writing stories, poems, and even creating marketing content. DeepSeek is more focused on technical functions and may not provide the same level of creative versatility as ChatGPT.\n\nYes, both DeepSeek and ChatGPT offer free trials for users to explore their features. Testing both tools can help you decide which one fits your needs. Whether you need a specialized, technical solution or a creative, versatile assistant, trying both for free will give you firsthand experience before committing to a paid plan.\n\nS\n\nI\n\nS\n\nS\n\nS\n\nP\n\nV\n\nY\n\nA\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\n",

    "title": "Is DeepSeek Better Than ChatGPT? A Detailed Comparison",
    "content": "As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, numerous AI language models have emerged, each competing to offer the best conversational capabilities, reasoning abilities, and contextual understanding. Two major contenders in this space are DeepSeek and ChatGPT.\n\nWhile OpenAI's ChatGPT has been widely recognized as a leader in conversational AI, DeepSeek is a new AI chatbot developed by a Chinese startup. It has gained popularity due to its speed, reasoning capabilities, and free access. Some users have reported that DeepSeek is better than ChatGPT in certain tasks, such as logic inference, mathematical reasoning, and coding.\n\nIn this article, we compare ChatGPT and DeepSeek across multiple dimensions to determine which AI model might be superior for various use cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nImagining how DeepSeek could differentiate itself from ChatGPT highlights the exciting possibilities in AI development. Advancements in any of these areas not only enhance functionality but also contribute to more meaningful and productive human-AI interactions.\n\nWhile I can't provide specific details about DeepSeek without updated information, considering these factors helps us understand what makes an AI assistant exceptional. It's not just about being better; it's about meeting users' evolving needs in innovative ways.\n\nIf DeepSeek is pushing the boundaries in these domains, it could indeed offer a compelling alternative to ChatGPT. The landscape of AI is ever-changing, and new entrants like DeepSeek (if they exist) play a crucial role in driving progress.\n\nThe real takeaway here is the potential for AI to become more integrated into our lives, assisting in ways we haven't even imagined yet. Whether it's through deeper personalization, advanced problem-solving, or enhanced accessibility, the future of AI holds immense promise.\n\nSo, while I await more information on DeepSeek, the prospect of such advancements is genuinely thrilling. It fuels the anticipation of what the next generation of AI tools will bring to the table, and how they'll empower us to achieve more.\n\nChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is built on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. It has undergone extensive training on diverse datasets, allowing it to generate coherent, context-aware, and highly engaging responses. The latest versions of ChatGPT have incorporated reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to enhance accuracy and usability.\n\nDeepSeek, a relatively newer AI model, claims to have advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities with a focus on deeper contextual understanding. It is designed to process longer conversations more effectively and aims to reduce biases present in AI-generated responses. DeepSeek’s underlying architecture is said to be an evolution of transformer-based AI but optimized for longer text retention and factual accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPTcurrently offers a more polished user experience and superior creative abilities. However, if DeepSeek fulfills its claims of superior factual accuracy and extended contextual memory, it could challenge ChatGPT in knowledge-intensive applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nBias is a significant concern in AI models. OpenAI has actively worked on reducing biases in ChatGPT, but it still sometimes reflects societal biases present in training data. DeepSeek claims to incorporate bias mitigation techniques that ensure more neutral and balanced outputs.\n\nIf DeepSeek delivers on this promise, it could be a significant advantage over ChatGPT, especially in areas where neutrality is crucial, such as news summarization or policy analysis.\n\nBoth models utilize high-performance cloud-based AI processing, but there are some key differences:\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, ChatGPT holds the edge in response speed and stability.\n\n\n\nOne of the key strengths of any AI language model is its ability to grasp context and nuance. ChatGPT performs well here, interpreting user inputs to generate coherent responses. If DeepSeek has enhanced context comprehension, it might deliver even more precise and relevant answers, especially in complex conversations.\n\nChatGPT's knowledge is current up to September 2023. If DeepSeek has access to more recent data, it could provide updates on the latest events, making it more informative for real-time queries. This edge in recency could make DeepSeek more appealing for users needing up-to-date information.\n\nPersonalization enhances user engagement. ChatGPT offers generalized responses, while DeepSeek might incorporate user preferences to tailor its replies. By adapting to individual styles and interests, DeepSeek could offer a more customized and engaging interaction.\n\nLanguage support broadens an AI's accessibility. ChatGPT handles multiple languages proficiently. If DeepSeek expands on this by supporting additional languages or dialects with higher fluency, it could serve a more diverse user base effectively.\n\nGenerating unbiased and ethical content is crucial. ChatGPT follows guidelines to avoid harmful or inappropriate content. If DeepSeek employs advanced algorithms to further minimize biases and ensure ethical responses, it would enhance trust and reliability.\n\nSeamless integration with other platforms enhances functionality. ChatGPT can be integrated into various applications through APIs. If DeepSeek offers smoother or more extensive integration capabilities, especially with popular tools and services, it could provide a more cohesive user experience.\n\nProcessing different types of data adds versatility. While ChatGPT primarily handles text, if DeepSeek can process images, audio, or video, it would offer richer interactions, catering to users' diverse needs.\n\nComplex problem-solving sets advanced AI apart. ChatGPT can assist with a variety of queries, but if DeepSeek excels in logical reasoning and can tackle intricate problems more effectively, it would be a valuable tool for specialized tasks.\n\nResponsive AI enhances user satisfaction. If DeepSeek operates with reduced latency and processes inputs faster than ChatGPT, it would improve user experience, especially in time-sensitive situations.\n\nAn intuitive interface makes an AI more user-friendly. ChatGPT is accessible across different platforms. If DeepSeek offers a more streamlined UI or better accessibility features for individuals with disabilities, it could reach a wider audience.\n\nProtecting user data is paramount. ChatGPT adheres to privacy guidelines, but if DeepSeek implements stronger encryption and privacy protocols, it could provide users with greater confidence in the security of their interactions.\n\nAffordability affects accessibility. ChatGPT offers both free and subscription-based services. If DeepSeek provides a more cost-effective model or additional value at a similar price point, it might be more attractive to a broader user base.\n\nSupport for developers expands an AI's utility. ChatGPT offers APIs for integration. If DeepSeek provides more robust developer tools or greater customization options, it could foster innovation and wider adoption in various industries.\n\nUnderstanding user emotions can make interactions feel more human. ChatGPT aims for neutral responses. If DeepSeek incorporates advanced sentiment analysis to respond with appropriate empathy, it could enhance the user experience in support and counseling applications.\n\nThe trajectory of an AI's development is key. ChatGPT continues to evolve with updates and improvements. If DeepSeek is built on a platform with significant growth potential, focusing on cutting-edge research and continual learning, it might surpass current capabilities and set new industry standards.\n\nDeciding between DeepSeek and ChatGPT comes down to what you value most in an AI language model.

DeepSeek aims to explore topics thoroughly, making it ideal for users who want to dive into complex subjects and uncover nuanced perspectives. ChatGPT, on the other hand, provides a wide-ranging knowledge base up to its last update in September 2023, making it a great all-around assistant for various topics without necessarily going into exhaustive detail on each.\n\nYour interaction experience matters greatly. DeepSeek may offer a more probing and introspective conversational style, encouraging you to think critically and reflect deeply. If you appreciate an AI that steers conversations into unexplored territories, this could be appealing. ChatGPT is crafted to be friendly, approachable, and efficient, making it suitable for quick answers or extended dialogue without pushing too far into any discomfort zones.\n\nEthical usage and safety protocols are essential. ChatGPT adheres to strict guidelines to provide respectful and appropriate content, avoiding sensitive or harmful topics unless necessary and handled carefully. Ensure that DeepSeek also upholds strong ethical standards, especially if it engages in deep and potentially sensitive discussions. Knowing that the AI respects user well-being can provide peace of mind.\n\nFinally, think about the future trajectory of each platform. ChatGPT benefits from continuous updates and improvements, backed by a strong developer community. If DeepSeek is emerging with innovative features and has a roadmap for growth, it might offer cutting-edge experiences that evolve over time. Assess the support, updates, and community engagement each platform offers to gauge their long-term viability.\n\nThe decision between DeepSeek and ChatGPT hinges on your personal preferences and how you intend to use the AI assistant. If you desire deep, thought-provoking conversations that challenge you, DeepSeek could be the better choice. If you prefer a versatile, reliable assistant for a variety of tasks, ChatGPT might suit you best. Consider trying both to see which one resonates more with your style and meets your needs effectively.\n\nWhile ChatGPT remains the dominant player in AI-powered conversations, DeepSeek is an exciting contender that could outperform ChatGPT in specific domains, particularly in long-form contextual accuracy and neutrality. However, ChatGPT’s broader application range, speed, and creative capabilities make it the better option for most users today.\n\nAs AI continues to advance, competition between models like DeepSeek and ChatGPT will drive improvements, ultimately benefiting users with more accurate, capable, and intelligent AI assistants.\n\nOverall, DeepSeek is a promising new AI chatbot that has the potential to become a major competitor to ChatGPT. However, it is important to note that DeepSeek is still under development, and its capabilities are not as comprehensive as ChatGPT.\n\nThe Scientific World is a Scientific and Technical Information Network that provides readers with informative & educational blogs and articles. \nSite Admin: Mahtab Alam Quddusi - Blogger, writer and digital publisher.\n\nThe Scientific World is a scientific and technical information network that provides readers with scientific news and articles, research materials, latest technology trends, business ideas, digital marketing strategies, lifestyle blogs, DIY ideas, health and fitness guide, environment and modern society related posts, and more.

    "title": "Speed of light - Wikipedia",
    "content": "\n\nThespeed of lightinvacuum, commonly denotedc, is a universalphysical constantthat is exactly equal to 299,792,458 metres per second (approximately 300,000 kilometres per second; 186,000 miles per second; 671 million miles per hour). It is exact because, by a 1983 international agreement, ametreis defined as the length of the path travelled bylightin vacuum during a time interval of1⁄299792458second. According to thespecial theory of relativity,cis the upper limit for the speed at which conventionalmatterorenergy(and thus anysignalcarryinginformation) can travel throughspace.[2][3][4]\n\nAll forms ofelectromagnetic radiation, includingvisible light, travel at the speed of light. For many practical purposes, light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. Muchstarlightviewed onEarthis from the distant past, allowing humans to study the history of the universe by viewing distant objects. Whencommunicatingwith distantspace probes, it can take minutes to hours for signals to travel. Incomputing, the speed of light fixes the ultimate minimumcommunication delay. The speed of light can be used intime of flightmeasurements to measure large distances to extremely high precision.\n\nOle Rømerfirstdemonstrated in 1676that light does not travel instantaneously by studying the apparent motion ofJupiter's moonIo. Progressively more accurate measurements of its speed came over the following centuries. In apaperpublished in 1865,James Clerk Maxwellproposed that light was anelectromagnetic waveand, therefore, travelled at speedc.[5]In 1905,Albert Einsteinpostulated that the speed of lightcwith respect to anyinertial frame of referenceis a constant and is independent of the motion of the light source.[6]He explored the consequences of that postulate by deriving thetheory of relativityand, in doing so, showed that the parameterchad relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism.\n\nMassless particlesandfieldperturbations, such asgravitational waves, also travel at speedcin vacuum. Such particles and waves travel atcregardless of the motion of the source or the inertial reference frame of theobserver. Particles with nonzerorest masscan be accelerated to approachcbut can never reach it, regardless of the frame of reference in which their speed is measured. In thetheory of relativity,cinterrelatesspace and timeand appears in the famousmass–energy equivalence,E=mc2.[7]\n\nIn some cases, objects or waves may appear to travelfaster than light(e.g.,phase velocitiesof waves,the appearance of certain high-speed astronomical objects, and particularquantum effects). Theexpansion of the universeis understood to exceed the speed of light beyonda certain boundary.\n\nThe speed at which light propagates throughtransparent materials, such as glass or air, is less thanc; similarly, the speed ofelectromagnetic wavesin wire cables is slower thanc. The ratio betweencand the speedvat which light travels in a material is called therefractive indexnof the material (n=⁠c/v⁠). For example, for visible light, the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at⁠c/1.5⁠≈200000km/s (124000mi/s); therefractive index of airfor visible light is about 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is about 90 km/s (56 mi/s) slower thanc.\n\nThe speed of light in vacuum is usually denoted by a lowercasec, for \"constant\" or the Latinceleritas(meaning 'swiftness, celerity'). In 1856,Wilhelm Eduard WeberandRudolf Kohlrauschhad usedcfor a different constant that was later shown to equal√2times the speed of light in vacuum. Historically, the symbolVwas used as an alternative symbol for the speed of light, introduced byJames Clerk Maxwellin 1865. In 1894,Paul Druderedefinedcwith its modern meaning.EinsteinusedVin hisoriginal German-language paperson special relativity in 1905, but in 1907 he switched toc, which by then had become the standard symbol for the speed of light.[8][9]\n\nSometimescis used for the speed of waves in any material medium, andc0for the speed of light in vacuum.[10]This subscripted notation, which is endorsed in official SI literature,[11]has the same form as related electromagnetic constants: namely,μ0for thevacuum permeabilityor magnetic constant,ε0for thevacuum permittivityor electric constant, andZ0for theimpedance of free space. This article usescexclusively for the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nSince 1983, the constantchas been defined in theInternational System of Units(SI) asexactly299792458m/s; this relationship is used to define the metre as exactly the distance that light travels in vacuum in1⁄299792458of a second. The second is, in turn, defined to be the length of time occupied by9192631770cyclesof the radiation emitted by acaesium-133atomin a transition between two specifiedenergy states.[12]By using the value ofc, as well as an accurate measurement of the second, one can  establish a standard for the metre.[13]\n\nThe particular value chosen for the speed of light provided  a more accurate definition of the metre that still agreed as much as possible with the definition used before 1983.[12][14]\n\nAs adimensional physical constant, the numerical value ofcis different for different unit systems. For example, inimperial units, the speed of light is approximately186282miles per second,[Note 3]or roughly 1footper nanosecond.[Note 4][15][16]\n\nIn branches of physics in whichcappears often, such as in relativity, it is common to use systems ofnatural unitsof measurement or thegeometrized unit systemwherec= 1.[17][18]Using these units,cdoes not appear explicitly because multiplication or division by1 does not affect the result. Its unit oflight-secondper second is still relevant, even if omitted.\n\nThe speed at which light waves propagate in vacuum is independent both of the motion of the wave source and of theinertial frame of referenceof the observer.[Note 5]This invariance of the speed of light was postulated by Einstein in 1905,[6]after being motivated byMaxwell's theory of electromagnetismand the lack of evidence for motion against theluminiferous aether.[19]It has since been consistently confirmed by many experiments.[Note 6]It is only possible to verify experimentally that the two-way speed of light (for example, from a source to a mirror and back again) is frame-independent, because it is impossible to measure theone-way speed of light(for example, from a source to a distant detector) without some convention as to how clocks at the source and at the detector should be synchronized.[20][21]\n\nBy adoptingEinstein synchronizationfor the clocks, the one-way speed of light becomes equal to the two-way speed of light by definition.[20][21]Thespecial theory of relativityexplores the consequences of this invariance ofcwith the assumption that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.[22][23]One consequence is thatcis the speed at which all massless particles and waves, including light, must travel in vacuum.[24][Note 7]\n\nSpecial relativity has many counterintuitive and experimentally verified implications.[26]These include theequivalence of mass and energy(E=mc2),length contraction(moving objects shorten),[Note 8]andtime dilation(moving clocks run more slowly). The factorγby which lengths contract and times dilate is known as theLorentz factorand is given byγ= (1 −v2/c2)−1/2, wherevis the speed of the object. The difference ofγfrom1 is negligible for speeds much slower thanc, such as most everyday speeds – in which case special relativity is closely approximated byGalilean relativity– but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity asvapproachesc. For example, a time dilation factor ofγ= 2 occurs at a relative velocity of 86.6% of the speed of light (v= 0.866c). Similarly, a time dilation factor ofγ= 10 occurs at 99.5% the speed of light (v= 0.995c).\n\nThe results of special relativity can be summarized by treating space and time as a unified structure known asspacetime(withcrelating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a specialsymmetrycalledLorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameterc.[29]Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such asquantum electrodynamics,quantum chromodynamics, theStandard Modelofparticle physics, andgeneral relativity. As such, the parametercis ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts thatcis also thespeed of gravityand ofgravitational waves,[30]and observations of gravitational waves have been consistent with this prediction.[31]Innon-inertial framesof reference (gravitationally curved spacetime oraccelerated reference frames), thelocalspeed of light is constant and equal toc, but the speed of light can differ fromcwhen measured from a remote frame of reference, depending on how measurements are extrapolated to the region.[32]\n\nIt is generally assumed that fundamental constants such aschave the same value throughout spacetime, meaning that they do not depend on location and do not vary with time. However, it has been suggested in various theories that thespeed of light may have changed over time.[33][34]No conclusive evidence for such changes has been found, but they remain the subject of ongoing research.[35][36]\n\nIt is generally assumed that the two-way speed of light isisotropic, meaning that it has the same value regardless of the direction in which it is measured. Observations of the emissions from nuclearenergy levelsas a function of the orientation of the emittingnucleiin a magnetic field (seeHughes–Drever experiment), and of rotatingoptical resonators(seeResonator experiments) have put stringent limits on the possible two-wayanisotropy.[37][38]\n\nAccording to special relativity, the energy of an object withrest massmand speedvis given byγmc2, whereγis the Lorentz factor defined above. Whenvis zero,γis equal to one, giving rise to the famousE=mc2formula for mass–energy equivalence. Theγfactor approaches infinity asvapproachesc, and it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object with mass to the speed of light. The speed of light is the upper limit for the speeds of objects with positive rest mass, and individual photons cannot travel faster than the speed of light.[39]This is experimentally established in manytests of relativistic energy and momentum.[40]\n\nMore generally, it is impossible for signals or energy to travel faster thanc. One argument for this follows from the counter-intuitive implication of special relativity known as therelativity of simultaneity. If the spatial distance between two events A and B is greater than the time interval between them multiplied bycthen there are frames of reference in which A precedes B, others in which B precedes A, and others in which they are simultaneous. As a result, if something were travelling faster thancrelative to an inertial frame of reference, it would be travelling backwards in time relative to another frame, andcausalitywould be violated.[Note 9][43]In such a frame of reference, an \"effect\" could be observed before its \"cause\". Such a violation of causality has never been recorded,[21]and would lead toparadoxessuch as thetachyonic antitelephone.[44]\n\nThere are situations in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information-carrying signal travels at speeds greater thanc, but they do not. For example, as is discussed in thepropagation of light in a mediumsection below, many wave velocities can exceedc. Thephase velocityofX-raysthrough most glasses can routinely exceedc,[45]but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.[46]\n\nIf a laser beam is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster thanc, although the initial movement of the spot is delayed because of the time it takes light to get to the distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedcfrom the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time.[47]In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.[48]\n\nThe rate of change in the distance between two objects in a frame of reference with respect to which both are moving (theirclosing speed) may have a value in excess ofc. However, this does not represent the speed of any single object as measured in a single inertial frame.[48]\n\nCertain quantum effects appear to be transmitted instantaneously and therefore faster thanc, as in theEPR paradox. An example involves thequantum statesof two particles that can beentangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in asuperpositionof two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state is observed, the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously. However, it is impossible to control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.[48][49]\n\nAnother quantum effect that predicts the occurrence of faster-than-light speeds is called theHartman effect: under certain conditions the time needed for avirtual particletotunnelthrough a barrier is constant, regardless of the thickness of the barrier.[50][51]This could result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster than light. However, no information can be sent using this effect.[52]\n\nSo-calledsuperluminal motionis seen in certain astronomical objects,[53]such as therelativistic jetsofradio galaxiesandquasars. However, these jets are not moving at speeds in excess of the speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is aprojectioneffect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.[54]\n\nA 2011 experiment whereneutrinos were observed to travel faster than lightturned out to be due to experimental error.[55][56]\n\nIn models of theexpanding universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. For example, galaxies far away from Earth are inferred to be moving away from the Earth with speeds proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called theHubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.[57]These recession rates, defined as the increase inproper distancepercosmological time, are not velocities in a relativistic sense. Faster-than-light cosmological recession speeds are only acoordinateartifact.\n\nInclassical physics, light is described as a type ofelectromagnetic wave. The classical behaviour of theelectromagnetic fieldis described byMaxwell's equations, which predict that the speedcwith which electromagnetic waves (such as light) propagate in vacuum is related to the distributed capacitance and inductance of vacuum, otherwise respectively known as theelectric constantε0and themagnetic constantμ0, by the equation[58]\n\nIn modernquantum physics, the electromagnetic field is described by the theory ofquantum electrodynamics(QED). In this theory, light is described by the fundamental excitations (or quanta) of the electromagnetic field, calledphotons. In QED, photons aremassless particlesand thus, according to special relativity, they travel at the speed of light in vacuum.[24]\n\nExtensions of QED in which the photon has a mass have been considered. In such a theory, its speed would depend on its frequency, and the invariant speedcof special relativity would then be the upper limit of the speed of light in vacuum.[32]No variation of the speed of light with frequency has been observed in rigorous testing, putting stringent limits on the mass of the photon.[59]The limit obtained depends on the model used: if the massive photon is described byProca theory,[60]the experimental upper bound for its mass is about 10−57grams;[61]if photon mass is generated by aHiggs mechanism, the experimental upper limit is less sharp,m≤10−14eV/c2(roughly 2 × 10−47g).[60]\n\nAnother reason for the speed of light to vary with its frequency would be the failure of special relativity to apply to arbitrarily small scales, as predicted by some proposed theories ofquantum gravity. In 2009, the observation ofgamma-ray burstGRB 090510found no evidence for a dependence of photon speed on energy, supporting tight constraints in specific models of spacetime quantization on how this speed is affected by photon energy for energies approaching thePlanck scale.[62]\n\nIn a medium, light usually does not propagate at a speed equal toc; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of aplane wave(a wave filling the whole space, with only onefrequency) propagate is called thephase velocityvp. A physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The overallenvelopeof the pulse travels at thegroup velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at thefront velocityvf.[63]\n\nThe phase velocity is important in determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented in terms of arefractive index. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio ofcto the phase velocityvpin the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity,polarization, or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. Therefractive index of airis approximately 1.0003.[64]Denser media, such aswater,[65]glass,[66]anddiamond,[67]have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible light.\n\nIn exotic materials likeBose–Einstein condensatesnearabsolute zero, the effective speed of light may be only a few metres per second. However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms, as do all slower-than-cspeeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light \"slowing\" in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a Bose–Einstein condensate of the elementrubidium. The popular description of light being \"stopped\" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had \"stopped\", it had ceased to be light. This type of behaviour is generally microscopically true of all transparent media which \"slow\" the speed of light.[68]\n\nIn transparent materials, the refractive index generally is greater than 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less thanc. In other materials, it is possible for the refractive index to become smaller than1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative.[69]The requirement that causality is not violated implies that thereal and imaginary partsof thedielectric constantof any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to theattenuation coefficient, are linked by theKramers–Kronig relations.[70][71]In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the wave will be absorbed quickly.[72]\n\nA pulse with different group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity is not the same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known asdispersion. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon calledslow light.[73]The opposite, group velocities exceedingc, was proposed theoretically in 1993 and achieved experimentally in 2000.[74]It should even be possible for the group velocity to become infinite or negative, with pulses travelling instantaneously or backwards in time.[63]\n\nNone of these options allow information to be transmitted faster thanc. It is impossible to transmit information with a light pulse any faster than the speed of the earliest part of the pulse (the front velocity). It can be shown that this is (under certain assumptions) always equal toc.[63]\n\nIt is possible for a particle to travel through a medium faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium (but still slower thanc). When acharged particledoes that in adielectricmaterial, the electromagnetic equivalent of ashock wave, known asCherenkov radiation, is emitted.[75]\n\nThe speed of light is of relevance totelecommunications: the one-way andround-trip delay timeare greater than zero. This applies from small to astronomical scales. On the other hand, some techniques depend on the finite speed of light, for example in distance measurements.\n\nIncomputers, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent betweenprocessors. If a processor operates at 1gigahertz, a signal can travel only a maximum of about 30 centimetres (1 ft) in a single clock cycle – in practice, this distance is even shorter since theprinted circuit boardrefracts and slows down signals. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other, as well asmemorychips, to minimize communication latencies, and care must be exercised when routing wires between them to ensuresignal integrity. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light may eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of singlechips.[76][77]\n\nGiven that the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about40075kmand thatcis about300000km/s, the theoretical shortest time for a piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67 milliseconds. When light is traveling inoptical fibre(atransparent material) the actual transit time is longer, in part because the speed of light is slower by about 35% in optical fibre, depending on its refractive indexn.[Note 10]Straight lines are rare in global communications and the travel time increases when signals pass through electronic switches or signal regenerators.[79]\n\nAlthough this distance is largely irrelevant for most applications, latency becomes important in fields such ashigh-frequency trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions of a second ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching tomicrowavecommunications between trading hubs, because of the advantage which radio waves travelling at near to the speed of light through air have over comparatively slowerfibre opticsignals.[80][81]\n\nSimilarly, communications between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There is a brief delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for communications betweenground controlandApollo 8when it became the first crewed spacecraft to orbit theMoon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least three seconds for the answer to arrive.[82]\n\nThe communications delay between Earth andMarscan vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot on the surface of Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until approximately4–24 minuteslater. It would then take a further4–24 minutesfor commands to travel from Earth to Mars.[83][84]\n\nReceiving light and other signals from distant astronomical sources takes much longer. For example, it takes 13 billion (13×109) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in theHubble Ultra-Deep Fieldimages.[85][86]Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they appeared 13 billion years ago, when the universe was less than a billion years old.[85]The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer theevolution of stars,of galaxies, andof the universeitself.[87]\n\nAstronomical distances are sometimes expressed inlight-years, especially inpopular sciencepublications and media.[88]A light-year is the distance light travels in oneJulian year, around 9461 billion kilometres, 5879 billion miles, or 0.3066parsecs. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10 trillion kilometres or nearly 6 trillion miles.Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.[89]\n\nRadarsystems measure the distance to a target by the time it takes a radio-wave pulse to return to the radar antenna after being reflected by the target: the distance to the target is half the round-triptransit timemultiplied by the speed of light. AGlobal Positioning System(GPS) receiver measures its distance toGPS satellitesbased on how long it takes for a radio signal to arrive from each satellite, and from these distances calculates the receiver's position. Because light travels about300000kilometres(186000miles) in one second, these measurements of small fractions of a second must be very precise. TheLunar Laser Ranging experiment,radar astronomyand theDeep Space Networkdetermine distances to the Moon,[90]planets[91]and spacecraft,[92]respectively, by measuring round-trip transit times.\n\nThere are different ways to determine the value ofc. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and Earth-based setups. It is also possible to determinecfrom other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constantsε0andμ0and using their relation toc. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equallingc. This is described in more detail in the\"Interferometry\" sectionbelow.\n\nIn 1983 the metre was defined as \"the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of1⁄299792458of a second\",[93]fixing the value of the speed of light at299792458m/sby definition, asdescribed below. Consequently, accurate measurements of the speed of light yield an accurate realization of the metre rather than an accurate value ofc.\n\nOuter spaceis a convenient setting for measuring the speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfectvacuum. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in theSolar System, such as theradiusof the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units.\n\nOle Rømerused an astronomical measurement to makethe first quantitative estimate of the speed of lightin the year 1676.[94][95]When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The difference is small, but the cumulative time becomes significant when measured over months. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being thediameterof the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect forJupiter's innermost major moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.[94]\n\nAnother method is to use theaberration of light, discovered and explained byJames Bradleyin the 18th century.[96]This effect results from thevector additionof the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5arcseconds)[97]it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled10210times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is10066times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.[96]\n\nAn astronomical unit (AU) is approximately the average distance between the Earth and Sun. It was redefined in 2012 as exactly149597870700m.[98][99]Previously the AU was not based on theInternational System of Unitsbut in terms of the gravitational force exerted by the Sun in the framework of classical mechanics.[Note 11]The current definition uses the recommended value in metres for the previous definition of the astronomical unit, which was determined by measurement.[98]This redefinition is analogous to that of the metre and likewise has the effect of fixing the speed of light to an exact value in astronomical units per second (via the exact speed of light in metres per second).[101]\n\nPreviously, the inverse ofcexpressed in seconds per astronomical unit was measured by comparing the time for radio signals to reach different spacecraft in the Solar System, with their position calculated from the gravitational effects of the Sun and various planets. By combining many such measurements, abest fitvalue for the light time per unit distance could be obtained. For example, in 2009, the best estimate, as approved by theInternational Astronomical Union(IAU), was:[102][103]\n\nThe relative uncertainty in these measurements is 0.02 parts per billion (2×10−11), equivalent to the uncertainty in Earth-based measurements of length by interferometry.[104]Since the metre is defined to be the length travelled by light in a certain time interval, the measurement of the light time in terms of the previous definition of the astronomical unit can also be interpreted as measuring the length of an AU (old definition) in metres.[Note 12]\n\nA method of measuring the speed of light is to measure the time needed for light to travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the working principle behind experiments byHippolyte FizeauandLéon Foucault.\n\nThesetup as used by Fizeauconsists of a beam of light directed at a mirror 8 kilometres (5 mi) away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.[105]\n\nThemethod of Foucaultreplaces the cogwheel with a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.[106]Foucault used this apparatus to measure the speed of light in air versus water, based on a suggestion byFrançois Arago.[107]\n\nToday, usingoscilloscopeswith time resolutions of less than one nanosecond, the speed of light can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror. This method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.[108]\n\nAn option for derivingcthat does not directly depend on a measurement of the propagation of electromagnetic waves is to use the relation betweencand thevacuum permittivityε0andvacuum permeabilityμ0established by Maxwell's theory:c2= 1/(ε0μ0). The vacuum permittivity may be determined by measuring thecapacitanceand dimensions of acapacitor, whereas the value of the vacuum permeability was historically fixed at exactly4π×10−7H⋅m−1through the definition of theampere.RosaandDorseyused this method in 1907 to find a value of299710±22 km/s. Their method depended upon having a standard unit of electrical resistance, the \"internationalohm\", and so its accuracy was limited by how this standard was defined.[109][110]\n\nAnother way to measure the speed of light is to independently measure the frequencyfand wavelengthλof an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value ofccan then be found by using the relationc=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of acavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946,Louis Essenand A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety ofnormal modesof microwaves of amicrowave cavityof precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8 μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry.[109]As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and fromelectromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.[109][111]\n\nThe Essen–Gordon-Smith result,299792±9 km/s, was substantially more precise than those found by optical techniques.[109]By 1950, repeated measurements by Essen established a result of299792.5±3.0 km/s.[112]\n\nA household demonstration of this technique is possible, using amicrowave ovenand food such as marshmallows or margarine: if the turntable is removed so that the food does not move, it will cook the fastest at theantinodes(the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the microwave frequency (usually displayed on the back of the oven, typically 2450 MHz), the value ofccan be calculated, \"often with less than 5% error\".[113][114]\n\nInterferometryis another method to find the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light.[Note 13]Acoherentbeam of light (e.g. from alaser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing theinterference patternand carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.\n\nBefore the advent of laser technology, coherentradiosources were used for interferometry measurements of the speed of light.[116]Interferometric determination of wavelength becomes less precise with wavelength and the experiments were thus limited in precision by the long wavelength (~4 mm (0.16 in)) of the radiowaves. The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light.[117]\n\nOne way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry.[117]This technique was due to a group at the National Bureau of Standards (which later became theNational Institute of Standards and Technology). They used it in 1972 to measure the speed of light in vacuum with afractional uncertaintyof3.5×10−9.[117][118]\n\nUntil theearly modern period, it was not known whether light travelled instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed. The first extant recorded examination of this subject was inancient Greece. The ancient Greeks, Arabic scholars, and classical European scientists long debated this until Rømer provided the first calculation of the speed of light. Einstein's theory of special relativity postulates that the speed of light is constant regardless of one's frame of reference. Since then, scientists have provided increasingly accurate measurements.\n\nEmpedocles(c. 490–430 BCE) was the first to propose a theory of light[127]and claimed that light has a finite speed.[128]He maintained that light was something in motion, and therefore must take some time to travel.Aristotleargued, to the contrary, that \"light is due to the presence of something, but it is not a movement\".[129]EuclidandPtolemyadvanced Empedocles'emission theoryof vision, where light is emitted from the eye, thus enabling sight. Based on that theory,Heron of Alexandriaargued that the speed of light must beinfinitebecause distant objects such as stars appear immediately upon opening the eyes.[130]\n\nEarly Islamic philosophersinitially agreed with theAristotelian viewthat light had no speed of travel. In 1021,Alhazen(Ibn al-Haytham) published theBook of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory ofvisionin favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye.[131]This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed,[129][132][133]and that the speed of light is variable, decreasing in denser bodies.[133][134]He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from the senses.[135]Also in the 11th century,Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnīagreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.[136]\n\nIn the 13th century,Roger Baconargued that the speed of light in air was not infinite, using philosophical arguments backed by the writing of Alhazen and Aristotle.[137][138]In the 1270s,Witeloconsidered the possibility of light travelling at infinite speed in vacuum, but slowing down in denser bodies.[139]\n\nIn the early 17th century,Johannes Keplerbelieved that the speed of light was infinite since empty space presents no obstacle to it.René Descartesargued that if the speed of light were to be finite, the Sun, Earth, and Moon would be noticeably out of alignment during alunar eclipse. Although this argument fails when aberration of light is taken into account, the latter was not recognized until the following century.[140]Since such misalignment had not been observed, Descartes concluded the speed of light was infinite. Descartes speculated that if the speed of light were found to be finite, his whole system of philosophy might be demolished.[129]Despite this, in his derivation ofSnell's law, Descartes assumed that some kind of motion associated with light was faster in denser media.[141][142]Pierre de Fermatderived Snell's law using the opposing assumption, the denser the medium the slower light travelled. Fermat also argued in support of a finite speed of light.[143]\n\nIn 1629,Isaac Beeckmanproposed an experiment in which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6 km) away. In 1638,Galileo Galileiproposed an experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid.[119][120]In 1667, theAccademia del Cimentoof Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment, with the lanterns separated by about one mile, but no delay was observed.[144]The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11microseconds.\n\nThe first quantitative estimate of the speed of lightwas made in 1676 by Ole Rømer.[94][95]From the observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moonIoappeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit.Christiaan Huygenscombined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of220000km/s, which is 27% lower than the actual value.[123]\n\nIn his 1704 bookOpticks,Isaac Newtonreported Rømer's calculations of the finite speed of light and gave a value of \"seven or eight minutes\" for the time taken for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth (the modern value is 8 minutes 19 seconds).[145]Newton queried whether Rømer's eclipse shadows were coloured. Hearing that they were not, he concluded the different colours travelled at the same speed. In 1729,James Bradleydiscoveredstellar aberration.[96]From this effect he determined that light must travel 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.[96]\n\nIn the 19th centuryHippolyte Fizeaudeveloped a method to determine the speed of light based on time-of-flight measurements on Earth and reported a value of315000km/s.[146]His method was improved upon byLéon Foucaultwho obtained a value of298000km/sin 1862.[105]In the year 1856,Wilhelm Eduard WeberandRudolf Kohlrauschmeasured the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge, 1/√ε0μ0, by discharging aLeyden jar, and found that its numerical value was very close to the speed of light as measured directly by Fizeau. The following yearGustav Kirchhoffcalculated that an electric signal in aresistancelesswire travels along the wire at this speed.[147]\n\nIn the early 1860s, Maxwell showed that, according to the theory of electromagnetism he was working on, electromagnetic waves propagate in empty space[148]at a speed equal to the above Weber/Kohlrausch ratio, and drawing attention to the numerical proximity of this value to the speed of light as measured by Fizeau, he proposed that light is in fact an electromagnetic wave.[149]Maxwell backed up his claim with his own experiment published in the 1868 Philosophical Transactions which determined the ratio of the electrostatic and electromagnetic units of electricity.[150]\n\nThe wave properties of light were well known sinceThomas Young. In the 19th century, physicists believed light was propagating in a medium called aether (or ether). But for electric force, it looks more like the gravitational force in Newton's law. A transmitting medium was not required. After Maxwell theory unified light and electric and magnetic waves, it was favored that both light and electric magnetic waves propagate in the same aether medium (or called theluminiferous aether).[151]\n\nIt was thought at the time that empty space was filled with a background medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as apreferred frameof reference for the propagation of light and therefore it should be possible to measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring theisotropyof the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which isthe experimentperformed byAlbert A. MichelsonandEdward W. Morleyin 1887.[152][153]The detected motion was found to always be nil (within observational error). Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light isisotropic(the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.[154]\n\nBecause of this experimentHendrik Lorentzproposed that the motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus tocontractalong its length in the direction of motion, and he further assumed that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly (\"local time\"), which led to the formulation of theLorentz transformation. Based onLorentz's aether theory,Henri Poincaré(1900) showed that this local time (to first order inv/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz's theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz's aether theory into full observational agreement with theprinciple of relativity.[155][156]\n\nIn 1905 Einstein postulated from the outset that the speed of light in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived thespecial theory of relativity, in which the speed of light in vacuumcfeatured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.[157][158]\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, much progress was made in increasing the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by laser interferometer techniques. These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950,Louis Essendetermined the speed as299792.5±3.0 km/s, using cavity resonance.[112]This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, themetre was redefinedin terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line ofkrypton-86, and, in 1967, the second was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state ofcaesium-133.[159]\n\nIn 1972, using the laser interferometer method and the new definitions, a group at the USNational Bureau of StandardsinBoulder, Coloradodetermined the speed of light in vacuum to bec=299792456.2±1.1 m/s. This was 100 times less uncertain than the previously accepted value. The remaining uncertainty was mainly related to the definition of the metre.[Note 15][118]As similar experiments found comparable results forc, the 15thGeneral Conference on Weights and Measuresin 1975 recommended using the value299792458m/sfor the speed of light.[162]\n\nIn 1983 the 17th meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) found that wavelengths from frequency measurements and a given value for the speed of light are morereproduciblethan the previous standard. They kept the 1967 definition of second, so thecaesiumhyperfine frequencywould now determine both the second and the metre. To do this, they redefined the metre as \"the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458of a second\".[93]\n\nAs a result of this definition, the value of the speed of light in vacuum is exactly299792458m/s[163][164]and has become a defined constant in the SI system of units.[13]Improved experimental techniques that, prior to 1983, would have measured the speed of light no longer affect the known value of the speed of light in SI units, but instead allow a more precise realization of the metre by more accurately measuring the wavelength of krypton-86 and other light sources.[165][166]\n\nIn 2011, the CGPM stated its intention to redefine all seven SI base units using what it calls \"the explicit-constant formulation\", where each \"unit is defined indirectly by specifying explicitly an exact value for a well-recognized fundamental constant\", as was done for the speed of light. It proposed a new, but completely equivalent, wording of the metre's definition: \"The metre, symbol m, is the unit of length; its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum to be equal to exactly299792458when it is expressed in the SI unitm s−1.\"[167]This was one of the changes that was incorporated in the2019 revision of the SI, also termed theNew SI.[168]",

That's about 186,282 miles per second — a universal constant known in equations as \"c,\" or light speed.\n\nAccording to physicistAlbert Einstein'stheory of special relativity, on which much of modern physics is based, nothing in the universe can travel faster than light. The theory states that as matter approaches the speed of light, the matter's mass becomes infinite. That means the speed of light functions as a speed limit for the wholeuniverse.\n\nThe speed of light is so immutable that, according to the U.S.National Institute of Standards and Technology, it is used to define international standard measurements like the meter (and by extension, the mile, the foot and the inch). Through some crafty equations, it also helps define the kilogram and the temperature unitKelvin.\n\nBut despite the speed of light's reputation as a universal constant, scientists and science fiction writers alike spend time contemplating faster-than-light travel. So far no one's been able to demonstrate a real warp drive, but that hasn't slowed our collective hurtle toward new stories, new inventions and new realms of physics.\n\nAlight-yearis the distance that light can travel in one year — about 6 trillion miles (10 trillion kilometers). It's one way that astronomers and physicists measure immense distances across our universe.\n\nLight travels from themoonto our eyes in about 1 second, which means the moon is about 1 light-second away. Sunlight takes about 8 minutes to reach our eyes, so thesunis about 8 light minutes away. Light fromAlpha Centauri, which is the nearest star system to our own, requires roughly 4.3 years to get here, so Alpha Centauri is 4.3 light-years away.\n\n\"To obtain an idea of the size of a light-year, take the circumference of the Earth (24,900 miles), lay it out in a straight line, multiply the length of the line by 7.5 (the corresponding distance is one light-second), then place 31.6 million similar lines end to end,\" NASA's Glenn Research Centersays on its website. \"The resulting distance is almost 6 trillion (6,000,000,000,000) miles!\"\n\nAn airplane traveling 600 mph (965 km/h) would take 1 million years to travel a single light-year! If we could travel one light-year using a crewed spacecraft like the Apollo lunar module, the journey would take approximately 27,000 years, according to theBBC Sky at Night Magazine.\n\nStars and other objects beyond oursolar systemlie anywhere from a few light-years to a few billion light-years away. And everything astronomers \"see\" in the distant universe is literally history. When astronomers study objects that are far away, they are seeing light that shows the objects as they existed at the time that light left them.\n\nThis principle allows astronomers to see the universe as it looked after theBig Bang, which took place about 13.8 billion years ago. Objects that are 10 billion light-years away from us appear to astronomers as they looked 10 billion years ago — relatively soon after the beginning of the universe — rather than how they appear today.\n\nRelated:Why the universe is all history\n\nWe asked Rob Zellem, exoplanet-hunter and staff scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, a few frequently asked questions about the speed of light.\n\nDr. Rob Zellem is a staff scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a federally funded research and development center operated by the California Institute of Technology. Rob is the project lead for Exoplanet Watch, a citizen science project to observe exoplanets, planets outside of our own solar system, with small telescopes. He is also the Science Calibration lead for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's Coronagraph Instrument, which will directly image exoplanets.\n\nNothing! Light is a \"universal speed limit\" and, according to Einstein's theory of relativity, is the fastest speed in the universe: 300,000 kilometers per second (186,000 miles per second).\n\nThe speed of light is a universal constant in a vacuum, like the vacuum of space. However, light *can* slow down slightly when it passes through an absorbing medium, like water (225,000 kilometers per second = 140,000 miles per second) or glass (200,000 kilometers per second = 124,000 miles per second).\n\nOne of the first measurements of the speed of light was by Ole Rømer in 1676 by observing themoons of Jupiter. The speed of light was first measured to high precision in 1879 by the Michelson-Morley Experiment.\n\nOle Rømer was able to measure the speed of light by observing eclipses of Jupiter's moon Io. When Jupiter was closer to Earth, Rømer noted that eclipses of Io occurred slightly earlier than when Jupiter was farther away. Rømer attributed this effect to the time it takes for light to travel over the longer distance when Jupiter was farther from the Earth.\n\n\n\nAs early as the 5th century BC, Greek philosophers like Empedocles and Aristotle disagreed on the nature of light speed. Empedocles proposed that light, whatever it was made of, must travel and therefore, must have a rate of travel. Aristotle wrote a rebuttal of Empedocles' view in his own treatise,On Sense and the Sensible, arguing that light, unlike sound and smell, must be instantaneous. Aristotle was wrong, of course, but it would take hundreds of years for anyone to prove it.\n\nIn the mid 1600s, the Italian astronomerGalileo Galileistood two people on hills less than a mile apart. Each person held a shielded lantern. One uncovered his lantern; when the other person saw the flash, he uncovered his too. But Galileo's experimental distance wasn't far enough for his participants to record the speed of light. He could only conclude that light traveled at least 10 times faster than sound.\n\nIn the 1670s, Danish astronomer Ole Rømer tried to create a reliable timetable for sailors at sea, andaccording to NASA, accidentally came up with a new best estimate for the speed of light. To create an astronomical clock, he recorded the precise timing of the eclipses ofJupiter's moon, Io, fromEarth. Over time, Rømer observed that Io's eclipses often differed from his calculations. He noticed that the eclipses appeared to lag the most whenJupiterand Earth were moving away from one another, showed up ahead of time when the planets were approaching and occurred on schedule when the planets were at their closest or farthest points. This observation demonstrated what we today know as the Doppler effect, the change in frequency of light or sound emitted by a moving object that in the astronomical world manifests as the so-calledredshift, the shift towards \"redder\", longer wavelengths in objects speeding away from us. In a leap of intuition, Rømer determined that light was taking measurable time to travel from Io to Earth.\n\nRømer used his observations to estimate the speed of light. Since the size of the solar system and Earth's orbit wasn't yet accurately known, argued a 1998 paper in theAmerican Journal of Physics, he was a bit off. But at last, scientists had a number to work with. Rømer's calculation put the speed of light at about 124,000 miles per second (200,000 km/s).\n\nIn 1728, English physicist James Bradley based a new set of calculations on the change in the apparent position of stars caused by Earth's travels around the sun. He estimated the speed of light at 185,000 miles per second (301,000 km/s) — accurate to within about 1% of the real value, according to theAmerican Physical Society.\n\nTwo new attempts in the mid-1800s brought the problem back to Earth. French physicist Hippolyte Fizeau set a beam of light on a rapidly rotating toothed wheel, with a mirror set up 5 miles (8 km) away to reflect it back to its source. Varying the speed of the wheel allowed Fizeau to calculate how long it took for the light to travel out of the hole, to the adjacent mirror, and back through the gap. Another French physicist, Leon Foucault, used a rotating mirror rather than a wheel to perform essentially the same experiment. The two independent methods each came within about 1,000 miles per second (1,609 km/s) of the speed of light.\n\n\n\nAnother scientist who tackled the speed of light mystery was Poland-born Albert A. Michelson, who grew up in California during the state's gold rush period, and honed his interest in physics while attending the U.S. Naval Academy, according to theUniversity of Virginia. In 1879, he attempted to replicate Foucault's method of determining the speed of light, but Michelson increased the distance between mirrors and used extremely high-quality mirrors and lenses. Michelson's result of 186,355 miles per second (299,910 km/s) was accepted as the most accurate measurement of the speed of light for 40 years, until Michelson re-measured it himself. In his second round of experiments, Michelson flashed lights between two mountain tops with carefully measured distances to get a more precise estimate. And in his third attempt just before his death in 1931, according to the Smithsonian'sAir and Spacemagazine, he built a mile-long depressurized tube of corrugated steel pipe. The pipe simulated a near-vacuum that would remove any effect of air on light speed for an even finer measurement, which in the end was just slightly lower than the accepted value of the speed of light today.\n\nMichelson also studied the nature of light itself, wrote astrophysicist Ethan Siegal in the Forbes science blog,Starts With a Bang. The best minds in physics at the time of Michelson's experiments were divided: Was light a wave or a particle?\n\nMichelson, along with his colleague Edward Morley, worked under the assumption that light moved as a wave, just like sound. And just as sound needs particles to move, Michelson and Morley and other physicists of the time reasoned, light must have some kind of medium to move through. This invisible, undetectable stuff was called the \"luminiferous aether\" (also known as \"ether\").\n\nThough Michelson and Morley built a sophisticated interferometer (a very basic version of the instrument used today inLIGOfacilities), Michelson could not find evidence of any kind of luminiferous aether whatsoever. Light, he determined, can and does travel through a vacuum.\n\n\"The experiment — and Michelson's body of work — was so revolutionary that he became the only person in history to have won a Nobel Prize for a very precise non-discovery of anything,\" Siegal wrote. \"The experiment itself may have been a complete failure, but what we learned from it was a greater boon to humanity and our understanding of the universe than any success would have been!\"\n\n\n\nEinstein's theory ofspecial relativityunified energy, matter and the speed of light in a famous equation: E = mc^2. The equation describes the relationship between mass and energy — small amounts of mass (m) contain, or are made up of, an inherently enormous amount of energy (E). (That's what makes nuclear bombs so powerful: They're converting mass into blasts of energy.) Because energy is equal to mass times the speed of light squared, the speed of light serves as a conversion factor, explaining exactly how much energy must be within matter. And because the speed of light is such a huge number, even small amounts of mass must equate to vast quantities of energy.\n\nTo accurately describe the universe, Einstein's elegant equation requires the speed of light to be an immutable constant. Einstein asserted that light moved through a vacuum, not any kind of luminiferous aether, and in such a way that it moved at the same speed no matter the speed of the observer.\n\nThink of it like this: Observers sitting on a train could look at a train moving along a parallel track and think of its relative movement to themselves as zero. But observers moving nearly the speed of light would still perceive light as moving away from them at more than 670 million mph. (That's because moving really, really fast is one of the only confirmed methods oftime travel— time actually slows down for those observers, who will age slower and perceive fewer moments than an observer moving slowly.)\n\nIn other words, Einstein proposed that the speed of light doesn't vary with the time or place that you measure it, or how fast you yourself are moving.\n\nTherefore, objects with mass cannot ever reach the speed of light. If an object ever did reach the speed of light, its mass would become infinite. And as a result, the energy required to move the object would also become infinite: an impossibility.\n\nThat means if we base our understanding of physics on special relativity (which most modern physicists do), the speed of light is the immutable speed limit of our universe — the fastest that anything can travel.\n\nAlthough the speed of light is often referred to as the universe's speed limit, the universe actually expands even faster. The universe expands at a little more than 42 miles (68 kilometers) per second for each megaparsec of distance from the observer, wrote astrophysicist Paul Sutter in a previous article forSpace.com. (A megaparsec is 3.26 million light-years — a really long way.)\n\nIn other words, a galaxy 1 megaparsec away appears to be traveling away from theMilky Wayat a speed of 42 miles per second (68 km/s), while a galaxy two megaparsecs away recedes at nearly 86 miles per second (136 km/s), and so on.\n\n\"At some point, at some obscene distance, the speed tips over the scales and exceeds the speed of light, all from the natural, regular expansion of space,\" Sutter explained. \"It seems like it should be illegal, doesn't it?\"\n\nSpecial relativity provides an absolute speed limit within the universe, according to Sutter, but Einstein's 1915 theory regardinggeneral relativityallows different behavior when the physics you're examining are no longer \"local.\"\n\n\"A galaxy on the far side of the universe? That's the domain of general relativity, and general relativity says: Who cares! That galaxy can have any speed it wants, as long as it stays way far away, and not up next to your face,\" Sutter wrote. \"Special relativity doesn't care about the speed — superluminal or otherwise — of a distant galaxy. And neither should you.\"\n\n\n\nLight in a vacuum is generally held to travel at an absolute speed, but light traveling through any material can be slowed down. The amount that a material slows down light is called its refractive index. Light bends when coming into contact with particles, which results in a decrease in speed.\n\nFor example, light traveling through Earth's atmosphere moves almost as fast as light in a vacuum, slowing down by just three ten-thousandths of the speed of light. But light passing through a diamond slows to less than half its typical speed,PBS NOVAreported. Even so, it travels through the gem at over 277 million mph (almost 124,000 km/s) — enough to make a difference, but still incredibly fast.\n\nLight can be trapped — and even stopped — inside ultra-cold clouds of atoms, according to a 2001 study published in the journalNature. More recently, a 2018 study published in the journalPhysical Review Lettersproposed a new way to stop light in its tracks at \"exceptional points,\" or places where two separate light emissions intersect and merge into one.\n\nResearchers have also tried to slow down light even when it's traveling through a vacuum. A team of Scottish scientists successfully slowed down a single photon, or particle of light, even as it moved through a vacuum, as described in their 2015 study published in thejournal Science. In their measurements, the difference between a slowed photon and a \"regular\" photon was just a few millionths of a meter, but it demonstrated that light in a vacuum can be slower than the official speed of light.\n\n—Spaceship could fly faster than light\n\n—Here's what the speed of light looks like in slow motion\n\n—Why is the speed of light the way it is?\n\nScience fiction loves the idea of \"warp speed.\" Faster-than-light travel makes countless sci-fi franchises possible, condensing the vast expanses of space and letting characters pop back and forth between star systems with ease.\n\nBut while faster-than-light travel isn't guaranteed impossible, we'd need to harness some pretty exotic physics to make it work. Luckily for sci-fi enthusiasts and theoretical physicists alike, there are lots of avenues to explore.\n\nAll we have to do is figure out how to not move ourselves — since special relativity would ensure we'd be long destroyed before we reached high enough speed — but instead, move the space around us. Easy, right?\n\nOne proposed idea involves a spaceship that could fold a space-time bubble around itself. Sounds great, both in theory and in fiction.\n\n\"If Captain Kirk were constrained to move at the speed of our fastest rockets, it would take him a hundred thousand years just to get to the next star system,\" said Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in Mountain View, California, in a 2010 interview withSpace.com's sister site LiveScience. \"So science fiction has long postulated a way to beat the speed of light barrier so the story can move a little more quickly.\"\n\nWithout faster-than-light travel, any \"Star Trek\" (or \"Star War,\" for that matter) would be impossible. If humanity is ever to reach the farthest — and constantly expanding — corners of our universe, it will be up to future physicists to boldly go where no one has gone before.\n\nFor more on the speed of light, check out this fun tool fromAcademothat lets you visualize how fast light can travel from any place on Earth to any other.

    "title": "Speed of light - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",
    "content": "Thespeed of light, in any medium, which is usually denoted byc{\\displaystyle c}, is aphysical constantimportant in many areas of physics. It is denoted by \"c0\" especially in vacuum medium, although the symbol 'c' can be used to refer to that in any medium. It is exactly 299,792,458 metres per second (983,571,056 feet per second) by definition.[1][2]Aphoton(particle of light) travels at this speed in avacuum.\n\nAccording tospecial relativity,c{\\displaystyle c}is the maximum speed at which all energy, matter, and physical information in the universe can travel. It is the speed of allmasslessparticles such as photons, and associatedfields—includingelectromagnetic radiationsuch aslight—in a vacuum.\n\nIt is predicted by the current theory to be the speed ofgravity(that is, gravitational waves). Such particles and waves travel atc{\\displaystyle c}regardless of the motion of the source or the inertialframe of referenceof the observer. In thetheory of relativity,c{\\displaystyle c}interrelatesspace and time, and appears in the famous equation ofmass–energy equivalenceE=mc2.[3]\n\nThe specialtheory of relativityis based on the prediction, so far upheld by observations, that the measured speed of light in a vacuum is the same whether or not the source of the light and the person doing the measuring are moving relative to each other. This is sometimes expressed as \"the speed of light is independent of the reference frame.\"\n\nThis behavior is different from our common ideas about motion as shown by this example:\n\nGeorge is standing on the ground next to some train tracks (railroad). There is a train rushing by at 30 mph (48 km/h). George throws a baseball at 90 mph (140 km/h) in the direction the train is moving. Tom, a passenger on the train, has a device (like a radar gun) to measure throwing speeds. Because he is on the train, Tom is already moving at 30 mph (48 km/h) in the direction of the throw, so Tom measures the speed of the ball as only 60 mph (97 km/h).\n\nIn other words, the speed of the baseball, as measured by Tom on the train, depends on the speed of the train.\n\nIn the example above, the train was moving at 1/3 the speed of the ball, and the speed of the ball as measured on the train was 2/3 of the throwing speed as measured on the ground.\n\nNow, repeat the experiment with light instead of a baseball; that is, George has a flashlight instead of throwing a baseball. George and Tom both have devices that are the same to measure the speed of light (instead of the radar gun in the baseball example).\n\nGeorge is standing on the ground next to some train tracks. There is a train rushing by at 1/3 the speed of light. George flashes a light beam in the direction the train is moving. George measures the speed of light as 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometres per second). Tom, a passenger on the train, measures the speed of the light beam. What speed does Tom measure?\n\nIntuitively, one may think that the speed of the light from the flashlight as measured on the train should be 2/3 the speed measured on the ground, just like the speed of the baseball was 2/3. But in fact, the speed measured on the train is the full value, 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometres per second), not 124,188 miles per second (199,861 kilometres per second).\n\nIt sounds impossible, but that is what one measures.\n\nA consequence of this fact, that the speed of light is the same for all (inertial) observers, is that no matter how much energy is used, nothing with mass can be accelerated to reach or go faster than the speed of light. Other key consequences of the constancy of the speed of light, that the lengths of two identical objects, and the rate at which two identical clocks tick, also depend on the reference frame of the observer. These ideas were discovered in the early 1900s byAlbert Einsteinin his theory ofSpecial Relativitywhich completely changed our understanding of space and time.\n\nMaxwell's equationspredicted the speed of light and confirmedMichael Faraday's idea that light was anelectromagnetic wave(a way that energy moves). From these equations, we find that the speed of light is related to the inverse of thesquare rootof the permittivity of free space,ε0, and the permeability of free space,μ0:\n\nTheindex of refractionof aclearmaterial is the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed of light in that material.\n\nOle Christensen Rømer used an astronomical measurement to make the first quantitative estimate of the speed of light.[4][5]When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being thediameterof theEarth's orbitaround the Sun. The observed change in the moon'sorbital periodis actually the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect forJupiter's innermost moonIo, and he deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.\n\nAnother method is to use the aberration of light, discovered and explained byJames Bradleyin the 18th century.[6]This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars,[7]it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun. This, with the known length of a year, can be easily converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.[6]\n\nNowadays, the \"light time for unit distance\"—the inverse ofc(1/c), expressed in seconds per astronomical unit—is measured by comparing the time for radio signals to reach different spacecraft in theSolar System. The position of spacecraft is calculated from the gravitational effects of the Sun and various planets. By combining many such measurements, abest fitvalue for the light time per unit distance is obtained. As of 2009[update], the best estimate, as approved by theInternational Astronomical Union(IAU), is:[8][9]\n\nThe relative uncertainty in these measurements is 0.02 parts per billion (2×10−11), as equivalent to the uncertainty in Earth-based measurements of length byinterferometry.[10]Since themetreis defined to be the length travelled by light in a certain time interval, the measurement of the light time for unit distance can also be interpreted as measuring the length of an AU in metres. The metre is considered to be a unit ofproper length, whereas the AU is often used as a unit of observed length in a given frame of reference.\n\nThe finite speed of light is a major constraint on long-distance space travel. Supposing a journey to the other side of theMilky Way, the total time for a message and its reply would be about 200,000 years. Even more seriously, no spacecraft could travel faster than light, so all galactic-scale transport would be effectively one-way, and would take much longer than than any moderncivilisationhas existed.\n\nThe speed of light can also be of concern over very short distances. Insupercomputers, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent betweenprocessors.[11]If a processor operates at 1gigahertz, a signal can only travel a maximum of about 30 centimetres (1 ft) in a single cycle. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimize communication latencies; this can cause difficulty with cooling. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light will eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of singlechips.[11]",

The speed of light in avacuumis aconstant valuethat is denoted by the lettercand is defined as exactly 299,792,458 meters per second.Visible light, other electromagnetic radiation, gravity waves, and other massless particles travel at c.Matter, which has mass, can approach the speed of light, but never reach it.\n\nHere are values for the speed of light in various units:\n\nThe speed of light in a vacuum is a constant. However, scientists are exploring whether the speed of light has changed over time.\n\nAlso, the rate at which light travels changes as it passes through a medium. Theindex of refractiondescribes this change. For example, theindex of refractionof water is 1.333, which means light travels 1.333 times slower in water than in a vacuum. The index of refraction of a diamond is 2.417. A diamond slows the speed of light by more than half its speed in a vacuum.\n\nOne way of measuring the speed of light uses great distances, such as distant points on the Earth or known distances between the Earth and astronomical objects. For example, you can measure the speed of light by measuring the time it takes for light to travel from a light source to a distant mirror and back again. The other way of measuring the speed of light is solving forcin equations. Now that the speed of light is defined, it is fixed rather than measured. Measuring the speed of light today indirectly measures the length of the meter, rather thanc.\n\nIn 1676, Danish astronomer Ole Rømer discovered light travels at a speed by studying the movement of Jupiter’s moon Io. Prior to this, it seemed light propagated instantaneously. For example, you see a lightning strike immediately, butdon’t hear thunder until after the event. So, Rømer’s finding showed light takes time to travel, but scientists did not know the speed of light or whether it was constant. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave that travelled at a speedc. Albert Einstein suggestedcwas a constant and that it did not change according to the frame of reference of the observer or any motion of a light source. In other words, Einstein suggested the speed of light isinvariant. Since then, numerous experiments have verified the invariance ofc.\n\nThe upper speed limit for massless particles isc. Objects that have mass cannot travel at the speed of light or exceed it. Among other reasons, traveling at c gives an object a length of zero andinfinitemass. Accelerating a mass to the speed of light requires infinite energy. Furthermore, energy, signals, and individual photos cannot travel faster thanc. At first glance, quantum entanglement appears to transmit information faster thanc. When two particles are entangled, changing the state of one particle instantaneously determines the state of the other particle, regardless of the distance between them. But, information cannot be transmitted instantaneously (faster thanc) because it isn’t possible to control the initial quantum state of the particle when it is observed.\n\nHowever, faster-than-light speeds appear in physics. For example, the phase velocity of x-rays through glass often exceeds c. However, the information isn’t conveyed by the waves faster than the speed of light. Distant galaxies appear to move away from Earth faster than the speed of light (outside a distance called the Hubble sphere), but the motion isn’t due to the galaxies traveling through space. Instead, space itself it expanding. So again, no actual movement faster thancoccurs.\n\nWhile it isn’t possible to go faster than the speed of light, it doesn’t necessarily mean warp drive or other faster-than-light travel is impossible. The key to going faster than the speed of light is to change space-time. Ways this might happen include tunneling using wormholes or stretching space-time into a “warp bubble” around a spacecraft. But, so far these theories don’t have practical applications.\n\n\n\n· © 2025Science Notes and Projects· Designed byPress Customizr··Cookies Policy·Terms of Service·",

    "content": "\n\nDune(titled on-screen asDune: Part One) is a 2021 Americanepicspace operafilm directed and co-produced byDenis Villeneuve, who co-wrote the screenplay withJon Spaihts, andEric Roth. It is the first of a two-part adaptation of the1965 novelbyFrank Herbert. Set in the distant future, the film followsPaul Atreidesas his family, the nobleHouse Atreides, is thrust into a war for the deadly and inhospitable desert planetArrakis.\n\nThe film is the third adaptation ofDune, followingDavid Lynch's1984 filmandJohn Harrison's2000 television miniseries. After an unsuccessful attempt byParamount Picturesto produce a new adaptation,Legendary Picturesacquired theDunefilm and television rights in 2016, with Villeneuve signing on as director in February 2017. Production contracts were secured only for the first film, relying on its success before a sequel would be produced.Principal photographytook place from March to July 2019 at locations includingBudapest,Jordan,Norway, andAbu Dhabi.  The cast includesTimothée Chalamet,Rebecca Ferguson,Oscar Isaac,Josh Brolin,Stellan Skarsgård,Dave Bautista,Stephen McKinley Henderson,Zendaya,Chang Chen,Sharon Duncan-Brewster,Charlotte Rampling,Jason Momoa, andJavier Bardem.\n\nDunewas scheduled for a late 2020 release but was delayed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic. The film premiered at the78th Venice International Film Festivalon September 3, 2021, before its international release on September 15, 2021; it was then released in United States theaters and streaming onHBO Maxon October 22, 2021.Dunegrossed $407.7 million on a $165 million budget. It was well received by critics and audiences with praise for Villeneuve's direction, screenplay, the performances of the cast, production values, costumes,Hans Zimmer's musical score, visual effects, cinematography, and retaining core elements from the source material. The film won six awards at the94th Academy Awardsand was nominated in four other categories; it receivednumerous other accolades. A sequel,Dune: Part Two, was released on March 1, 2024, with another sequel based on Herbert's 1969 novelDune Messiahin development.\n\nIn the distant future, DukeLeto Atreidesis assigned by thePadishah EmperorShaddam IVto replace BaronVladimir Harkonnenas thefiefholderofArrakis, a harshdesert planetand the sole source of \"spice\", a valuable psychotropic substance that imparts heightened vitality and awareness. Spice is also key tointerstellar travel, givingSpacing GuildNavigators the ability to guidestarshipsto traverse space instantaneously and safely. Emperor Shaddam, fearful of Leto's rising power, plots for House Harkonnen to retake Arrakis, secretly aided by hisSardaukartroops, and destroy House Atreides. Leto is suspicious of the Emperor but weighs the risks against the power of controlling Arrakis and making an alliance with its mysterious natives, theFremen.\n\nLeto'sconcubine,Lady Jessica, is an acolyte of theBene Gesserit—an exclusive sisterhood whose members possess advanced physical and mental abilities. As part of a centuries-longbreeding program, they instructed her to bear a daughter whose son would become the Kwisatz Haderach—a Bene Gesserit andmessianicsuperbeing with theclairvoyancenecessary to guide humanity to a better future. Jessica disobeyed and bore a son,Paul, who is trained by Leto's aides,Duncan Idaho,Gurney Halleck, theSuk doctorWellington Yueh, and theMentatThufir Hawat, and she teaches him Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul confides in Jessica and Duncan about troubling visions of the future. The Reverend Mother and ImperialTruthsayerGaius Helen Mohiamsubjects Paul to a deadlygom jabbartest to assess his humanity and impulse control, which he passes.\n\nHouse Atreides arrives atArrakeen, the principal stronghold on Arrakis. Duncan's advance party has made contact with the Fremen. The natives revere Paul and Jessica, which she explains is due to the Bene Gesseritsowing beliefson Arrakis centuries earlier. An attempt to assassinate Paul with ahunter-seekerfails. At a secret meeting on the Harkonnen planetGiedi Prime, Mohiam insists Baron Harkonnen spare Paul and Jessica in his coup, to which he duplicitously agrees.\n\nLeto meets and negotiates with Fremen chieftainStilgarand meets the ImperialJudge of the Change, Dr.Liet Kynes, aplanetologistwho lives among the Fremen. Kynes briefs them on the dangers of spice harvesting, and the giantsandwormsthat travel under the desert and render unwise the use of protectiveshields. During a flight, they rescue a stranded spice-harvesting crew from a sandworm, and Paul's exposure to the spice triggers intense premonitions.\n\nYueh betrays the Atreides and disables Arrakeen's shields, allowing the Harkonnens and Sardaukar to invade. He incapacitates Leto, planning to exchange him for his wife, the Baron's prisoner. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule with which the Duke can assassinate the Baron. After the Baron double-crosses and murders Yueh, Leto releases the gas, killing himself and the Baron's Mentat,Piter De Vries, but the Baron survives. Though the Baron has arranged to have Paul and Jessica dropped deep in the desert to die, a compassionate Yueh has left them with afremkitwith survival supplies. Jessica uses a Bene Gesserit technique called \"the Voice\" to overpower and kill their captors. Overnighting in the desert, Paul—surrounded by spice—has visions of a bloodyholy warfought across the universe in his name.\n\nAfter conquering Arrakis, Baron Harkonnen appoints his nephewRabbanto oversee the planet, and orders him to restart spice production to recoup the invasion's cost. Meanwhile, Duncan and Kynes find Jessica and Paul, who discloses his plan to marry one of Emperor Shaddam's daughters to avert a potential civil war arising from the Emperor's betrayal. They are discovered by Sardaukar soldiers armed with alasgun, and Duncan sacrifices himself, enabling Paul and Jessica's escape. Kynes also tries to escape but is caught and mortally wounded, and lures a sandworm to her location to devour herself and the Sardaukar. Deep in the desert, Paul and Jessica encounter Stilgar's Fremen tribe, includingChani, the young woman from Paul's visions. Despite Stilgar's lenience towards them, Fremen warriorJamischallenges Paul to a ritual duel to the death, which Paul wins. Contrary to Jessica's wishes, Paul joins the Fremen, determined to fulfill his father's goal of bringing peace to Arrakis.\n\nAdditionally,Benjamin Clementineportrays the Herald of the Change, the head of anImperialdelegation toCaladan.Marianne Faithfull(in her final film role),Jean Gilpin, andEllen Dubinvoice the ancestral Bene Gesserit whose voices are heard by Paul in his visions.[4]Joe Walker, the film's editor, provides the narration for Paul's filmbook guides for Arrakis.[6]ChoreographerMilena Sidorovaportrays the Baron's human-spider hybrid pet viamotion capture.[7]\n\nFollowing the publication ofFrank Herbert's novelDunein 1965, it was considered as having potential for a possible film adaptation. Since 1971, various producers have held film adaptation rights for the novel. Attempts to make an adaptation based on the book were considered to be \"unfilmable\" due to its breadth of content.[8][9][10]The book's status among fans meant that deviations without strong justification could potentially harm the film's reputation.[11]\n\nAlejandro Jodorowskyacquired the rights in the 1970s to make a fourteen-hour adaptation of the book, but the project ultimately failed to secure sufficient funds. This development effort became the subject of the documentary filmJodorowsky's Dune(2013).[12]David Lynch'sDune, produced byRaffaella De Laurentiisin 1984, was intended as a three-hour film but was cut to 137 minutes; it was poorly received and Lynch himself ended up disowning it.[11][13]In 1996, producerRichard P. Rubinsteinacquired the rights to the novel.Frank Herbert's Dune, a live-action miniseries produced by Rubinstein and directed byJohn Harrison, aired on theSci Fi Channelin 2000; it was a ratings hit and was generally better received than Lynch's film. Some reviewers criticized the miniseries for lacking the spectacle afforded to a feature film production, as well as for staying too faithful to the book and being bogged down byexposition.[14][15]Prospects to make a successful adaptation ofDuneimproved after the critical and commercial success of the film series adaptations ofThe Lord of the RingsandHarry Potter, both of which maintained most of the works' key characters and plots while managing the limited running time.[11]In 2008,Paramount PictureshiredPeter Bergto direct an adaptation.[16]Berg left the project in October 2009,[17]with directorPierre Morelbeing hired in January 2010.[18]Paramount later cancelled the project in March 2011, as they could not come to key agreements, with their rights reverting to Rubinstein.[19][20]\n\nIn 2011,Mary Parent, vice chair of worldwide production forLegendary Pictures, and her producer partnerCale Boyter, acquired adaptation rights forDune.[21]Legendary obtained film and TV rights forDunein November 2016.[22][23]Canadian filmmakerDenis Villeneuveexpressed interest in the project in September 2016, saying that \"a longstanding dream of mine is to adaptDune, but it's a long process to get the rights, and I don't think I will succeed\".[24]By December, Villeneuve was in talks with the studio to direct the film.[25]His enthusiasm to direct aDunefilm earned Parent's respect, with Parent hiring Villeneuve after hearing him describe his vision for the film. He chose to completeArrival(2016) andBlade Runner 2049(2017) first, as he wanted to spend more time to developDuneand co-write it himself, employing his past experience directingscience fictionfilms during development.[21][26]Villeneuve signed on to direct the film by January 2017, approximately one week after earning a nominationAcademy Award for Best DirectorforArrival.[27]By that February, Villeneuve was officially confirmed as the director.[28]\n\nSome of Villeneuve's previous collaborators onArrivalandBlade Runner 2049returned forDune, including film editorJoe Walker,[29]production designerPatrice Vermette, visual effects supervisorPaul Lambert, sound designer and editorTheo Green, sound editorMark Mangini,[30]and special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer.[31]Other previous collaborators were slated to work onDunebut dropped out before production began, including visual effects supervisorJohn Nelson[32]and cinematographerRoger Deakins, who was replaced in December 2018 withGreig Fraser.[33]Dunewas produced by Villeneuve, Parent, and Cale Boyter, with Tanya Lapointe, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert,Thomas Tull, Jon Spaihts, Richard P. Rubinstein, John Harrison, and Herbert W. Gain serving as executive producers andKevin J. Andersonas creative consultant.[34][35]Game of Throneslanguage creatorDavid J. Petersonwas confirmed as aconstructed languagedeveloper for the film in April 2019.[36]\n\nIn March 2018, Villeneuve stated that his goal was to adapt the novel into a two-part film series.[37]He secured a two-movie deal with Warner Bros. Pictures, in the same style as the two-part adaptation ofStephen King'sItin2017and in2019. He chose to make two films as he felt that the novel was too large and complex for one.[38]Subsequent dealings secured the production of the first film and new production deals were made to start production for the second.[39]Eric Rothwas hired to co-write the screenplay in April,[40]with Legendary CEO Joshua Grode affirming that the studio planned on making a sequel.[41]Roth, who had read the book as a child, had a neutral opinion of it, which allowed him to have an \"objective view of it\". He wrote a 50-page treatment for the film and focused on appealing to groups of people who enjoyed the book, did not remember nor care for the book, and those who were not familiar with it at all.[42]Villeneuve completed a first draft of the script by May 2018,[43][44]Producer Brian Herbert stated that the fourth draft of the screenplay, submitted in July, would cover the first half of the events from the novel,[45]whileJon Spaihtswas later hired as co-writer alongside Roth and Villeneuve in September.[46]Though the book features many elements inspired from Arab and Islamic culture, Spaihts stated the team minimized incorporating them as he felt Arab culture became integrated into the world, resulting in the need to \"invent more and borrow less\" due to potentially overemphasizing them.[47]Eventually, Roth worked on the film again after completing his work onKillers of the Flower Moon(2023), providing feedback after a screening of the film and aiding in rewrites prior to reshoots.[42]\n\nWhen writing his script, Villeneuve chose not to take inspiration from Lynch'sDune,wanting instead to directly refer to the book despite affirming his respect for Lynch and the film.[48]He described his reaction to the film as being \"half-satisfied\", and felt he would make the film with a \"different sensibility\".[49]Similarly, he chose not to incorporate concepts Jodorowsky envisioned for hisDunefilm, as he felt it would be \"very presumptuous and arrogant\".[50]He was not intimidated by previous film adaptations as he felt his love forDuneallowed him to focus on his own vision. He compared his experience of making the film to archaeology, describing the process as \"going back in time and finding those images mixed with emotions, and bringing them back to life\".[21]\n\nIn adapting the book for a contemporary audience, Villeneuve considered his screenplay \"acoming-of-age story, but also a call for action for the youth\" and noted the book's social commentary regardingcapitalismand the exploitation of natural resources such as oil.[38]In doing so, Villeneuve wanted to recreate the experience he had felt when he initially read the book as a teen.[51]He adjusted and modified many parts of the novel for the film, and wanted to keep \"the atmosphere and poetry ... intact\".[52]This included eliminating internal monologues and epigraphs used in the book and simplifying the \"pseudo-antiquated\" dialogue.[21]Instead, he emphasized Paul and Jessica's relationship as the main focus of the story, and gave them a secret hand gesture language they could use to communicate silently to each other. The film also minimizes the political aspects of theDuneworld in order to retain the book's scale and exploration of power dynamics while also focus on Paul's growth.[52]The inclusion of the informativeholographicfilmbook videos for Paul was adapted from the book, with Villeneuve wanting it to convey Paul's \"appetite for learning\" and his desire to learn about the Arrakis and Fremen culture.[51]\n\nSome characters were given less prominence, such as Baron Harkonnen, members of his court, and the Mentats Thufir Hawat and Piter De Vries, but established enough so that they can be used in the future.[52]Villeneuve sought to depict the Baron as a complex antagonist rather than as a caricature, feeling the novel presented him as being the latter, and took inspiration fromColonel KurtzofApocalypse Now(1979).[38][51]Another major change was altering some of thecharacter arcsof the female characters in the book to give them more respect and prominence, as Villeneuve felt femininity was a crucial theme in the book.[52]Ferguson stated that while Villeneuve respected Herbert's characterization in the book, Villeneuve's modifications had helped improve the quality of female characters by expanding the role of Lady Jessica as a soldier and member of the Bene Gesserit. As such, the studio labeled this role a \"warrior priestess\", in contrast to the joking label of \"space nun\" that Villeneuve felt was implied by the book.[38]\n\nVilleneuve began the casting process by first determining who would portrayPaul Atreides. He approached actors on an individual basis and felt the final cast was close to his \"dream list\".[53]For Paul, Villeneuve desired an actor who had \"an old soul in the body of a teenager\".  He identifiedTimothée Chalametas the ideal choice for the role, later admitting that he had no alternate choices in mind.[54][55]Chalamet, who previously auditioned for a role in Villeneuve'sPrisoners(2013),[27]also desired to collaborate with Villeneuve and appear inDune. He travelled to theCannes Film Festivalto discuss the role with Villeneuve.[27][56]Chalamet entered final negotiations to play the role of Paul in July 2018.[57][58]Rebecca Fergusonentered negotiations that September to play the role of Paul's mother,Lady Jessica, with Chalamet already confirmed for the role of Paul.[46]Ferguson was initially dismissive of the role, as she felt it was too similar to herMission: Impossiblerole as Ilsa Faust. Ferguson did not want to betypecastas a \"strong female character\".[59]However, she was convinced after hearing Villeneuve's ideas and reading the book, saying she enjoyed the \"simplicity of wanting to save something you have created and all of these shades\".[60]She had been cast by January 2019.[61]\n\nCasting director Francine Maisler had compiled over 30–50 audition tapes from actors for Villeneuve to decide from when casting secondary roles.[62]Dave Bautistawas offered the role ofGlossu Rabbanfollowing a phone call from Villeneuve. He was an avid fan of Villeneuve and wanted to contact him, but was surprised when Villeneuve contacted him first and says he is proud of being offered the role.[63]Villeneuve wantedStellan Skarsgårdto portrayBaron Vladimir Harkonnenas he had found Skarsgård intimidating, and personally contactedCharlotte Ramplingin order to portrayGaius Helen Mohiam, who accepted as she enjoyed Villeneuve's work.[64]Oscar Isaaccontacted Villeneuve about starring in the film once he heard it was in development. Villeneuve cast him asDuke Leto, with Isaac commenting the role suited him physically.Zendayaauditioned for the role ofChanialongside five other actresses. She was chosen as she was considered to have the best performance with Chalamet.[62]Jenna Ortegaalso auditioned for the role.[65]Bautista,[66]Skarsgård,[67]Rampling,[68]Isaac,[69]and Zendaya all joined the cast in January 2019.[70]\n\nIn the next month,Javier Bardem,[71]Josh Brolin,[72]Jason Momoa,[73]andDavid Dastmalchianwere cast asStilgar,Gurney Halleck,Duncan Idaho, andPiter de Vries, respectively.[74]Villeneuve directly called Bardem and offered him the role, who was shocked as he wanted to portray Stilgar, comparing it to his personal love for Aragorn inThe Lord of the Rings. Meanwhile, Brolin amusingly commented that he pretended to read the script prior to accepting the role, while Momoa received his casting call when he was snowboarding down a mountain. He later contacted Villeneuve on aSkypecall to confirm his involvement.[56]Dastmalchian's casting was similar to Brolin and Momoa's, as he received a call while he was in hisLos Angeleshome, and accepted the role without reading the script due to his confidence in Villeneuve.[75]Stephen McKinley Hendersonjoined in March,[35]withChang Chenentering negotiations.[35][76]Maisler chose Henderson after admiring his work in New York theaters, and curated a list of the \"most talented\" Chinese actors for the role of Dr. Yueh. Despite initial difficulties contacting Chen, they eventually contacted his manager in China. Afterwards, Chen accepted his role as Dr. Yueh. The decision to castBenjamin Clementineas the Herald of the Change occurred after Maisler enjoyed his performance in theTiny Desk Concerts.[62]\n\nSharon Duncan-Brewsterauditioned for her role inLondonthrough Jina Jay, a casting director working with Maisler at the time, saying that she \"exudes an intelligence and a power and an inner strength\". When Maisler presented a shortlist for potential cast members, Villeneuve selected Duncan-Brewster.[62]Her casting was confirmed in April 2020.[38]The idea to change Kynes' gender was suggested by Jon Spaihts, which Villeneuve promptly accepted.[52]According to Duncan-Brewster, Villeneuve opted for the change as he felt it was not necessary to adhere to all of the elements in the book in order to remain faithful to the character's nature.[39]\n\nThe set design was done by production designerPatrice Vermette.[77]Vermette based the set design forDuneby the need \"to ground the story into realistic settings to help the audience believe in the extraordinary elements\". He sought to make the sets as realistic and immersive as possible, using minimal set extensions and no greenscreens.[21][78]Prior to the creation of any sets or visual effects, Villeneuve and a group of specific people, worked together to define the visual language for the film.[21]\n\nVermette created a \"visual bible\" to guide the development of set design and keep it consistent with the film's visual effects design, intending to help \"extrapolate the world\". He also re-read the novel, as he felt that \"the book gives a lot of clues or cues that will help you navigate it to design things, but it's quite nonspecific\", adding that he wanted to support Villeneuve's original vision of the novel when he read it as a young teenager, and base the design around Herbert's original novel.[78][79][80]The team's earlymood boardsfor the visual language of the film consisted of Mesopotamianzigguratarchitecture, Egyptian references,World War IIbunkers, Brazilian and Sovietbrutalist architecture, minimalist megastructures and dams designed bySuperstudio, and imagery of glaciers taking over mountains.[21]\n\nThe design for the ornithopters was conceived by Villeneuve and storyboard artist Sam Hudecki. Villeneuve wanted the ornithopter to be \"muscular\"; he wanted it to resemble a dragonfly and helicopter, but also appear realistic and adhere to basic laws of science. This fit in with his overall perception of theDuneworld beingretro-futuristicand analog. He also wanted the cockpits to be designed so that the actors could see the landscape. Two functional ornithopter models, 48- and 75-feet long, were created for filming by London propmakers, with operable doors and interior cockpit areas. They weighed over 11 tons and required anAntonovcargo plane to transport them to filming locations in Hungary and Jordan. One ornithopter used in filming had customizable pieces allowing for more space. Cranes were used to make the models fly.[81][82]\n\nMany practical sets were created on the soundstages and backlots of the Origo Film Studios inBudapest, Hungary, serving as interiors for the three planets. When designing Caladan, Vermette sought to give the planet \"a feeling of melancholia\". He wanted Caladan to resemble autumn in Canada, his home country, as he thought that it represented \"the end of a cycle... or the beginning of a new one\". He identified \"dramatic coastal mountain ranges\" and forests containing Norwegian pines as defining features of the planet.[78]Meanwhile, the interior sets of Caladan were inspired by medieval Japanese aesthetics, particularly that of Paul's training room, containing intricate screens and diffused lighting. Props were created by set decorator Richard Roberts, including custom-made furniture, lighting, textiles produced in Denmark, and other items designed to look antique.[81]\n\nThe original design for the sandworm was deemed \"prehistoric\", inspired by whales withbaleenin their mouths.[83]The sandworm's skin texture was based on tree bark and mud flats. Vermette spoke of the challenges involved in creating the set designs used for the sandworms, stating \"It was a creature that commanded respect, and it's almost seen as a deity in the world of the Fremen. So that's why the first time you see the depiction of the sand worm on the mural, it's presented with sun coming out of its mouth\".[84]\n\nThe design for Arrakeen was influenced by the book's description of Arrakis's climate, with Vermette calling it \"the biggest residency ever built by humankind\" and \"a response as a colonial entity that took over the planet for the exploitation of ... spice\". He designed the city in a \"rock bowl\" shape to protect its infrastructure from sandworms, and built buildings at an angle to protect them from high wind speeds. The walls were thickened to make the interiors cooler. The team was inspired by WWII bunkers, bunkers,Mayan temples, and Brazilian modernism. The history and culture of the Fremen was depicted in variousmuralsthroughout the residence, with Vermette comparing it to that of a church after envisioning Fremen artists doing so in order to depict the colonization of Arrakis.[21][80][84]One practical set was the environmental lab in which Sardaukar soldiers descend from the air. The circular dome was 20 feet high, with the spokes being created by a special kind of cloth fabric, giving the illusion of shadows and providing proper lighting for the act. Agriculturally controlled sand was placed on the ground as filming took place during Budapest's raining season.[79]\n\nOver 1000 looks for Arrakis, Caladan, and Giedi Prime were designed by the team for the film.[85]The costume design was done byJacqueline WestandBob Morgan. Villeneuve wanted the costumes to be \"grounded\" in history while avoiding conventional futuristic views in science fiction films.[86][87]West performed \"psychological studies\" of characters and historical research to associate their houses with historical \"symbolic analogs\", facilitating her costume design process. She took primary inspiration from theMiddle Ages, particularly envisioning what it would look like in the future. She associated the Fremen with theFrench Resistanceand the Sardaukar with theNaziswhen designing the costumes. Additionally, she took inspiration fromGiotto,Francisco Goya,Caravaggio, and British art historianJohn Berger, while emulating styles from the fashion ofBalenciaga, theBedouin, andTuareg people.[86][85]\n\nWest associated the Spacing Guild with theAvignon Papacy, connected their persecution of theTemplarsto that of House Atreides; she noted that the Emperor and his allies betrayed House Atreides. Reference pictures consisted of medieval popes and modernized it when designing their costumes.[86]The Bene Gesserit sorceresses' costumes were based ontarot cardsandchess pieces, while the Harkonnen armor was designed to resemble a bug's shell, using medieval drawings of \"insects, spiders, ants, praying mantises and lizards\" as reference.[88]Meanwhile, the Atreides' costumes were based on theRomanovs, describing their costumes as having a \"simplicity ... that was regal\".[89]Lady Jessica's dresses in the first half of the film were inspired by the works ofCristóbal Balenciaga, while the turmeric-toned gown she wears while landing on Arrakis was influenced by Middle Eastern clothing and paintings of women in North Africa.[21][86]\n\nWest cited the filmsLawrence of Arabia(1962),Doctor Zhivago(1965), andFahrenheit 451(1966) as further inspirations for costume diversity. She also researched Roman and Greek mythology, feeling that the Atreides-Harkonnen feud was similar to a \"real Greek and Roman tragedy\". She dyed thegauzefor Fremen cloth in desert colors, inspired by the sand and rocks in Jordanian filming locations.[85]A prototype for the stillsuit was designed by West and Jose Fernandez at Ironhead Studios in Los Angeles. The prototype was then taken to Origo Studios, where a factory was set up to design additional suits within two weeks. He hired European artisans to create concept designs and over 150 individual pieces for the suits. Over 250 stillsuits were used when filming in Jordan. The suits were designed to be flexible and comfortably fit the actor's body, while also remaining accurate to the book. They created \"micro-sandwiches\" of acrylic fibers and porous cottons, which absorbed the moisture and allowed the actors to remain cool inside the suits. Tubing also ran through the micro-sandwiches for increased flexibility. Zippers and buttons were not used as they were deemed \"archaic\".[86][85][88]\n\nPrincipal photographybegan on March 18, 2019, at Origo Film Studios inBudapest, Hungary, withGreig Fraserserving as cinematographer.[29][35][90]The film was shot for theIMAXformat with an IMAX-certifiedArri Alexa LFcamera and an IMAX-certifiedAlexa Mini LFprototype, equipped withPanavision's large-format lenses in the Ultra Vista and H-series lineup. Select scenes had aspect ratios opened up to 1.90:1 on all IMAX screens, and to 1.43:1 on select IMAX screens outfitted with IMAX's dual-laser projection system. The finished footage was transferred to 35mm film stock, then scanned back to 4K, in order to achieve a more film-like look.[91][92]Filming occurred inWadi Rum, Jordan, which doubled for Arrakis.[35][93][94]TheLiwa Oasisin theUnited Arab Emiratesalso served as a key backdrop for Arrakis, with filming there occurring across 11 days. Local businesses, freelancers fromTwofour54, and crews consisting of over 100 people offered assistance during the shoot.[95][96][97]Scenes featuring the rock formations functioning as the Fremens' heat shelters were filmed at theRub' al Khalidesert.[98]Stadlandet, Norwaydoubled for the planet Caladan.[99]Filmingwrappedon July 26, 2019.[100][101]Additional filming took place in Budapest by August 2020, which did not alter the film's then-December 2020 release date.[102][103]\n\nParts of the Arrakeen invasion, such as shots of Gurney, extras, and practical explosions up to approximately five kilometers high, were filmed onbacklotsin Budapest.[104]Duke Leto's death scene was the final scene filmed by Isaac, in which he decided to film it nude as he felt it was similar to Christ's crucifixion. He also came up with the idea of including the bull's head, identifying it as an \"omen\".[105]Ornithopter interiors were filmed on hilltops outside Budapest, with a 25-foot high and 360° sand-colored ramp circling a largegimbal, allowing Fraser to film with natural sunlight.[106][107]Supervising stunt coordinator and second unit director Tom Struthers developed unique combat styles for major factions. When working on the action sequence between Idaho and the Sardaukars, he based Idaho's combat style from Greek and Roman warfare techniques, and the Sardaukar's fromRussian soldiers in WWIIwanting to \"mow down the enemy\".[108]Chalamet learned the sandwalking technique, designed by choreographerBenjamin Millepied, prior to filming Arrakis scenes in order to convey Paul's natural adeptness at it and \"responsibility to show Jessica in that moment\".[109]Footage of helicopters flying over the UAE were filmed with six high-resolution cameras, being utilized as reference footage for ornithopters.[107][110]\n\nDNEGcontributed to over 30 scenes in the film, creating 1,200 VFX shots out of the 1,700 total, with vendors including Wylie Co. and Rodeo FX.[112][113]Many shots used variouschroma keyprocesses. Visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert used \"sandscreens\" for filming scenes in Arrakis and Arrakeen; instead of usinggreen-based backgrounds, the visual effects team used sand-colored ones that matched the establishing desert shots intended for backgrounds. The sandscreens were used in capturing scenes of the ornithopter, with the VFX team using the helicopter footage and replacing them with the ornithopter models, facilitating capture of sand displacement. This was also filmed by encapsulating ornithopter models in black boxes with fans blowing dust. The wings were inserted usingcomputer-generated imagery(CGI).[110][83][111]Similar processes were used to film scenes in other settings, as it facilitated compositing the foreground and background imagery: Caladan scenes used \"grayscreens\" and those with a \"slight blue tint\" for interior and exterior scenes, respectively, Salusa Secundus scenes used bluescreens.[106][83][114]Approximately 18 tons of sand and dust were used on set, with the effect of blowing sand being created by using aV8 enginewith a fan on the back of a tractor.[115]\n\nThe sandworms were created through CGI. The VFX team found a lot of difficulty in deciding how the sandworm would move. The team spent over a year in figuring out the movements of the sandworm, and researched the body movements of various animals, such as worms and snakes. The sand ripples created by the worms were inspired by implicit visual cues of the shark fromJaws(1975).[116]The special-effects supervisorGerd Nefzerdesigned a vibrating 8x8 foot steel plate and placed it under the sand. This resulted in the formation of various patterns, used to signify an approaching sandworm. The vibrating areas were also later enhanced to cover a larger area.[106][107]The team initially considered using rigged explosives to capture the motion of the sandworms breaking the surface in the desert, but rejected the idea as this was impractical to perform in the Middle East. Instead, they used theHoudinisoftware to have sand emulate the motion of water. Villeneuve did not want the associated sound design to appear as a studio production. Sound designers Mark Mangini and Theo Green used a \"fake documentary realism\" approach to capture natural sounds and manipulate them for use in the film, such as recording the sounds of shifting sands inDeath Valleyusinghydrophones.[83]\n\nTheMontrealandVancouverfacilities of DNEG were used for the Arrakeen invasion sequence. It involved combining practical and digital effects. The Montreal VFX supervisor Brian Connor created a digital Arrakeen space port, while the Vancouver team simulated explosions. Practical explosions filmed in Budapest backlots were later enhanced by the VFX team: the visual effects team had rigs of practical light shining through the fog from explosions, allowing them to blend practical and digital shots easier.[104]Lambert created theHoltzman shields' visual effects by combining past and future frames after experimenting with various visual filters on an action sequence fromSeven Samurai(1954), resulting in a \"shimmering\" look Villeneuve approved. They also added colors; they used blue for bouncing objects and red for penetrations. The scene of Paul's future vision was filmed usingmotion-capture(mo-cap), and the team replicated mo-cap to add many fighters. Animation supervisor Robyn Luckham helped with the scene as the team did not know much about mo-cap. They also added explosions in the foreground, sandworms in the background, sand displacement throughout, and used more simulations to render the scene in real-time.[107]\n\nThe team created a detailed practical stuffy model for the desert mouse and filmed it in Jordan for appropriate desert lighting. The animation team used footage of idling animals as reference, and animated the mouse so it \"expends effort when absolutely necessary\".[117]Thecreosote bushhologram was created by projecting different \"slices\" of light on Chalamet's face during plate photography based on his filming location using aprojector. Wylie then completed the scene by adding the hologram around him. For the hunter-seeker, a stick on set was used as reference, being later replaced with proper models via CGI. Practical rigs were attached to Skarsgård's body to create the effect of the Baron's levitation. The levitation was occasionally done practically with a seesaw rig. However, the suspensor device attached to his back was inserted using CGI.[110][118]\n\nHans Zimmeraffirmed he would be scoringDunenear the start of the film's production in March 2019.[35]Zimmer previously worked with Villeneuve onBlade Runner 2049(2017). At the time, Zimmer rejected directorChristopher Nolan's request to compose the score for his then-upcoming filmTenet(2020), citing his personal love for the book.[119]Zimmer did not want the soundtrack to sound like his previous works and used instruments atypical of a Western orchestra.[120]He avoided watching Lynch'sDuneso as not to be influenced byToto's music, instead spending a week in aUtahdesert to incorporate its sounds into the score. The music was performed using an eclectic set of instruments, including some created specifically for the soundtrack. Performers for the score include guitaristGuthrie Govanand vocalistLoire Cotler. Additional music was composed by Steve Mazzaro and David Fleming, both of whom worked in collaboration with Zimmer to keep his pieces on theme.[120]The soundtrack pieces includebagpipesfor the House Atreides theme, which was suggested as Villeneuve's idea of something \"ancient and organic\". Zimmer found 30 bagpipe players aroundEdinburghduring theCOVID-19 pandemicand recorded them playing in a church.[121]\n\nFor the firstDunetrailer, Zimmer supervised a 32-person choir viaFaceTime(necessitated by pandemic restrictions) for the recording of a cover ofPink Floyd's song \"Eclipse\". Choir members gathered in groups of four over eight separate sessions inSanta Monicaat Zimmer'sRemote Controlstudio while Zimmer conducted from home.[122]\n\nThree soundtrack albums were released for the film byWaterTower Music, includingThe Dune Sketchbook (Music from the Soundtrack),Dune (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), andThe Art and Soul of Duneon September 3, September 17, and October 22, 2021, respectively. Villeneuve said Zimmer spent \"months and months creating new instruments, defining, creating, and seeking new sounds, pushing the envelope\" and praised his work on the film. Twosingleswere released on July 22, titled \"Paul's Dream\" and \"Ripples in the Sand\".[123]The film's score was nominated for theBest Score Soundtrack for Visual Mediaat the2022 Grammy Awards.[124]\n\nIn April 2020,Vanity Fairpublished a two-part extensive first-look report onDune.[38]Empireprovided additional first looks in October ahead of the film's trailer release.[125]Ateaser trailerwas released on September 9 featuring a remix of thePink Floydsong \"Eclipse\" (1973) combined with Zimmer's score.[126][127]Zack Sharf ofIndieWiregave the trailer a positive review, and wrote \"It's full of eye-popping set design\", in addition to stating, \"The two [Denis Villeneuve and Greig Fraser] have brought a tangibility to Frank Herbert's world that should makeDunea visceral experience for moviegoers.\"[128]Miles Surrey fromThe Ringeralso gave the trailer a positive review, and felt the trailer \"undoubtedly looks promising,\" and noted that, though the source material has been \"notoriously unadaptable,\" he felt \"the curse could be broken,\" due to the cast and Villeneuve's direction.[129]Similarly,Deadline Hollywood's Dino-Ray Ramos also praised the trailer for its scale, writing that it contained \"sci-fi prestige and the epic scale that includes mind-boggling action, elegant cinematography and fantastical nuances that still leave room for grounded and very human storytelling\".[127]\n\nThe first ten minutes of the film were screened in selectIMAXtheaters worldwide on July 21 and 22, 2021, in an event that also included a behind-the-scenes look at the film and the debut of the film's theatrical trailer, on July 22.[130][131]Angela Wattercutter ofWiredstated that the trailer \"is begging you to see it in theaters\".[132]Jennifer Yuma fromVarietypraised the cast and visuals, and praised its scope, calling the trailer \"epic\".[133]Similarly, Aaron Couch fromThe Hollywood Reporteralso praised the cast and thought the film was an \"ambitious sci-fi adaptation\".[134]Anthony BreznicanfromVanity Fairalso gave the trailer a positive review and stated, \"It will seem more mysterious to those unfamiliar with the story, but like Chani does herself in those dream missives to Paul, it hints at big, impressive things to come\".[135]Vulture's Zoe Haylock was also impressed by the trailer, and advocated watching the film in theaters, praising the visuals as \"transcendental natural settings\".[136]Writing forEntertainment Weekly, Christian Holub felt the trailer \"sets the stage cleanly\".[137]\n\nOn February 26, 2019,Funcomentered into an exclusive partnership withLegendary Entertainmentto develop games related to the upcomingDunefilms.[138]An artbook,The Art and Soul of Dune, was released alongside the film on October 22, 2021. The book was written by the executive producer Tanya Lapointe, and it included a soundtrack album of the same name composed by Zimmer. The book was available in both a standard and deluxe edition.[139]In September 2020,McFarlane Toysstarted a line of 7-inch figures modeled after characters from the film.[140]A 12-inch figure of Baron Harkonnen was introduced at the same time.[140]The action figures were released in December 2020.[141]Legendary ComicsannouncedDune: The Official Movie Graphic Novelvia Kickstarter and published the comic in December 2022 by writerLilah Sturgesand art by Drew Johnson.[142]\n\nDunewas originally scheduled to be released on November 20, 2020, but was pushed back to December 18, 2020.[143][144]The film was then delayed by theCOVID-19 pandemic, this time to October 1, 2021, taking over the release date slot ofThe Batman, where it was theatrically released in3D.[145]In late June 2021, Warner Bros. delayed the film's American release date again by three weeks to October 22, 2021, to avoid competition withNo Time to Die.[146]Over a month prior to its North American release, the film began its theatrical roll-out in most international markets, beginning on September 15 with France, Germany, Russia, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Spain and Belgium.[147][148]A week ahead of the United States release, Warner Bros. announced that the film's availability on HBO Max would start on the evening of October 21, 2021, correlating with typical early Thursday theatrical showings for films released on Fridays (although the studio had not been doing early Thursday previews for most of the rest of their hybrid theatrical/HBO Max releases. The other exception beingThe Suicide Squad, which had the same strategy for its early Thursday previews/HBO Max release).[149]\n\nLike all 2021 Warner Bros. films,Dunewas streamed simultaneously onHBO Maxfor a period of one month.[150]The film was then removed from the service and followed the normal home media release schedule,[150][151]similar to the process Warner Bros. used forWonder Woman 1984(2020).[152]Many production companies and directors expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, including Villeneuve and Legendary Pictures.[153]In a column published inVariety, Villeneuve expressed concerns about the film's financial success andpiracy.[154]\n\nDunehad its world premiere at the78th Venice International Film Festivalon September 3, 2021.[155][156]It also screened at theToronto International Film Festivalwith anIMAXpremiere screening at theOntario PlaceCinesphereon September 11, 2021.[157]Jason Momoatested positive forCOVID-19after attending the film's London premiere on October 15, 2021.[158]On October 17, the film was leaked online ahead of its planned US and HBO Max release.[159]The film returned for a theatrical run at IMAX theaters from December 3, 2021.[160]From January 24, 2024, screenings included an exclusive preview ofDune: Part Twoahead of its March 2024 release.[161]\n\nThe film was released digitally on December 3, 2021, whileBlu-ray, 3D Blu-ray,DVDandUltra HD Blu-rayversions of the film were released on January 11, 2022, byWarner Bros. Home Entertainment.[162]After its release on home media,Duneranked first on the \"NPDVideoScan First Alert\" chart for combined Blu-ray and DVD sales as well as the dedicated Blu-ray sales chart.[163]According toThe Numbers, it sold a combined 215,375 Blu-ray and DVD units in the first week for $3.6 million.[164]It retained the top position on both the charts of the NPD Group for the following two weeks before being displaced byGhostbusters: Afterlife.[165][166]In addition, it was the most rented title fromRedboxkiosks for three weeks as well.[167]It was the highest-selling movie for the month of January according to the \"NPD VideoScan First Alert\" chart.[168]\n\nDunegrossed $108.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $298.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $407.7 million.[3]Deadline Hollywoodreported that a total box office gross of $300 million, the combined cost of production and marketing, \"will make many happy from an image-standpoint, even ifbreakevenis far north of that\".[169]Vulturesaid the film needed $350–400 million to reach its break-even point, whileForbessaid it required \"somewhere around $500 million\" to do so.[170][171]\n\nIn the US and Canada, the film made $41 million in its opening weekend from 4,125 theaters,[172]surpassing its projected opening weekend estimates of $30–35 million and besting the debut ofGodzilla vs. Kong($31.6 million) for the highest opening weekend for Warner Bros. during the pandemic era.[169][173]Of that opening weekend take, $17.5 million came from its first day ticket sales, including $5.1 million from Thursday night previews.Dunealso had the best opening of Villeneuve's career.[172]The film fell 62% in its second weekend to $15.5 million, though it remained atop the domestic box office.[174][175]In its third weekend it dropped by 51% to earn $7.6 million, and was displaced byEternalsfrom the top rank.[176]On November 25, 2021,Dunebecame the second Warner Bros. film of the pandemic era to cross $100 million in the US and Canada, followingGodzilla vs. Kong.[177]\n\nThe film was released in 14 markets outside the US and Canada on September 15, 2021. It grossed $37.9 million, with the largest markets being Russia and CIS ($8.9 million),[178]France ($7.2 million), Germany ($4.4 million), Taiwan ($3.4 million), Italy ($2.5 million) and Spain ($2.4 million).[179]After adding an additional $26.3 million from 32 countries in its second weekend, the film had a 10-day running total of $76.5 million.[180]\n\nIn China,Duneopened to a $21.6 million weekend according to estimates by Warner Brothers, ranking second on the country's box office behindThe Battle at Lake Changjin.[181]In its fourth week of release outside the US and Canada, the film made $21.4 million in 75 countries, a drop of 54% from the previous weekend.[182]It also fell by 78% to about $5 million in China, dropping to the third rank.[183][184]The film crossed the $300 million global mark on November 2.[185]During the fifth weekend it earned $11.1 million, a drop of 52%.[186]This included $2.1 million in China where it dropped to the fifth rank.[187]\n\nAfter its return to IMAX for a week on December 2, the film earned an estimated $1.8 million during the weekend, a drop of 13% from the previous weekend, primarily due to earning around $1 million from IMAX. In Australia it debuted atop the box office chart, earning $3.4 million in the opening weekend.[188]The $400 million global mark was crossed on February 14, 2022, with the largest running-total countries outside the US and Canada being China ($39.5 million), France ($32.6 million), the UK ($30 million), Germany ($22.5 million) and Russia ($21.3 million).[189]\n\nAccording toSamba TV, the film was watched in over 1.9 million US households during its first three days of release,[190]which grew to 2.3 million within its first week of release.[191]3.9 million US households watched the film within its first 30 days of release.[192]According toTV Time, it was the most-watched film overall in the United States from the first to the third week of its release consecutively,[193]before dropping to the sixth rank in its fourth week.[194]The film rose to the third rank on TV Time's chart in the final week of its availability.[195][151]It was the ninth-most-streamed-film of 2021 according to the service.[196]By March 20, the film was streamed in 5.3 million households in the US, including 996,000 since the Oscar nomination announcements on February 8.[197]\n\nAfter its release onPVODservices,Dunedebuted at the second position oniTunesandVuducharts and was ranked seventh onGoogle Play.[198]The following week it fell to the seventh position on iTunes and the third position on Vudu, while maintaining its ranking on Google Play.[199]After falling out of the charts for two weeks, it found renewed interest as it rose to the tenth position on iTunes, seventh position on Google Play, and the fifth position on Vudu.[200]In the following week, it fell out of the iTunes and Google Play charts again, while dropping to the tenth position on the Vudu chart.[201]\n\nThe film was the highest-selling title onRedbox's digital service for the week of January 24–30, 2022.[202]It was also the top-ranked film on iTunes during the same week.[203]Following the Academy Awards nominations, it reentered the top 10 charts for iTunes, Google Play and Vudu.[204]\n\nOn thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 83% of 514 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Duneoccasionally struggles with its unwieldy source material, but those issues are largely overshadowed by the scope and ambition of this visually thrilling adaptation.\"[205]Metacriticgave the film aweighted averagescore of 74 out of 100, based on 68 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[206]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an 84% positive score (with an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars) and 66% saying they would definitely recommend it.[172]Following its premiere at theVenice Film Festivalin September 2021, early reception was generally positive, receiving praise for its ambition, story, scope, worldbuilding, performances (particularly those of Chalamet and Ferguson) and production values, although some critics considered the story to be incomplete and dull. Its writing and scope continued to be praised following its release, while others criticized the runtime, pacing, and adaptation of the source material.[207][208][209]\n\nBen Travis ofEmpire,Robbie Collin fromThe Daily Telegraph, and Xan Brooks atThe Guardianrated the film five out of five stars.[210][211][212]Travis praised the writing and direction, feeling it helped properly establish elements ofworldbuilding. He also lauded Fraser's cinematography and Zimmer's score, calling the film \"blockbuster filmmaking in the Christopher Nolan mould\", and praising Chalamet and Ferguson's performances. However, he felt that the \"emotional strings\" did not work as well.[210]Brooks agreed with the sentiment that it was a high-quality blockbuster film and found it \"the missing link bridging the multiplex and the arthouse\", citing the worldbuilding, ensemble cast, andset piecesas positive elements.[212]Collins also praised the writing and Chalamet and Ferguson's performances, feeling the exposition was written well. However, he highlighted the production design and the sandworms, calling the latter \"threateningly alien, but also enticing, even addictive\" and commenting \"the sets ring with the desolate grandeur of ancient ruins\".[211]\n\nIn a positive yet more critical review,Justin Changof theLos Angeles Timesfelt the film used thematic elements from the novel well, and also lauded the production values albeit labelling the visual aesthetic asmonochromatic. Chang further went on to praise the plot for increasing the role of women in the story and tension regarding anticipation of action sequences, which he thought were directed well. However, he disliked the \"abrupt, unsatisfying\" ending and wanted Villeneuve's style to align withDavid Lynch's style, which he considered to contain \"feverish, pustular imagery\".[213]Leah Greenblatt ofEntertainment Weekly, who graded the film a B, wrote thatDunehad little exposition and also appreciated the worldbuilding and visual aesthetic. However, she did not appreciate the jokes and felt the script gradually adjusted \"and soon settles into a kind of grim grandeur\", highlighting Chalamet and Isaac's performances.[214]The New York Times'sManohla Dargisalso admired the production values and worldbuilding, adding the exposition and pacing was appropriate to establish the latter. However, while she felt Villeneuve had attempted to be faithful to the source material, she also opined that Villeneuve was trying to satisfy the demands of the contemporary film industry. Her major issues were also with the ending and what she deemed to be a \"white man leading a fateful charge\", though she refrained from labelling it awhite savior narrative.[215]\n\nCriticOwen Gleiberman's review inVarietywas more negative: he appreciated the film's extensive focus on worldbuilding, but felt it had also undermined the storytelling. He found the title of \"Dune Part I [sic]\" to be \"presumptuous\", regarding it to be analogous to how other film franchises advertise future installments. Gleiberman felt the film's spectacles, including the sandworm and ornithopter sequences, disengage him from the story, saying \"as the movie begins to run out of tricks, it turns woozy and amorphous\".[216]Reviewing the film forTheWrap, Steve Pond noted the film's darker tone had remained consistent, and cited the production design and scope as positive elements. Pond enjoyed the action sequences on Arrakis and appreciated that Villeneuve \"finds some dark poetry in the way he plays up the story's mystical elements\". However, he was mixed on the film's dark tone, regarding it as a tonal deviation from his previous films but also allowing it to be \"giant mood piece that can be exhilarating in its dark beauty\".[217]Roxana Hadadi's review inVulturecritiqued the way the film flattened the cultural and religious complexities of the book and opted for a more generic portrayal of people of color without specific representation fromMiddle Eastern or North African(MENA) actors.[47]\n\nOther commentators and academics also perceived the film to have neglected andappropriatedArabian and Islamic elements which influencedDune, and to have excluded MENA actors. Serena Rasoul, founder ofMuslim Casting, wanted more MENA representation and labelled the lack of MENA actors an \"erasure\". She also acknowledged the cast's overall diversity and did not call the filmOrientalist.[218]Ph.D. student in History atPrinceton UniversityHaris Durrari deemed it to be Orientalist as he opined it reduced Arab influences to \"exotic aesthetics\" and \"broad abstractions\".[219]Meanwhile, Ali Karjoo-Ravary, an Assistant Professor of Islamic Studies atBucknell University, felt that the casting of African actors excluded MENA actors, and that characters portrayed by African people felt \"ultimately empty\" as they had died or were not as developed as Paul and Lady Jessica.[220]\n\nDunewas nominated for tenAcademy Awards(winning six),[221]threeGolden Globe Awards(winning one),[222]elevenBritish Academy Film Awards(winning five),[223]tenCritics' Choice Movie Awards(winning three),[224]twoAACTA International Awards(winning one),[225]tenSatellite Awards(winning five),[226]oneGrammy Award,[227]oneHollywood Music in Media Awards(won),[228]fourPeople's Choice Awards,[229]oneScreen Actors Guild Awards,[230]threeDorian Awards(winning one),[231]and oneNickelodeon Kids' Choice Award(won),[232]oneMovieGuide Award(won),[233]among others. It was also ranked as one of the top ten films of 2021 by theAmerican Film Institute.[234]\n\nKara Kennedy concluded that some parts are very faithful to the source material while others are heavily adjusted, such as the opening of the story and the portrayal of the Harkonnen.[235]Frank Jacob found that the film has a strongerOrientalizationof the Fremen than Lynch's film adaptation, shown through elements such as Chani appearing like theAfghan Girlon the cover ofNational Geographicin 1985.[236]Edwardo Pérez explored the depiction of the Fremen, masculinity and femininity, and issues of cultural appropriation in the film. He perceived Paul's \"feminine\" Bene Gesserit skills and \"masculine\" military training as contributing to his initial \"androgynous\" and timid nature, later becoming masculine after killing Jamis. According to him, this alongside Duke Leto's sympathy during Paul's concerns about being leader showed that one must acknowledge their masculine and feminine nature for success by pursuing leadership passively.[237][238]\n\nYosr Dridi found screenplay changes made to adjust the source material for a \"culturally-aware and race-conscious 21st century audience\" as eliminating the Arab and Oriental elements for the story, and focusing more on Fremen culture and society rather than the elements of geopolitical worldbuilding from the book, noting how Princess Irulan's original historical epigraphs in the book being replaced with Chani's narration. However, Dridi stated that the film framed Fremen society through Paul's perspective, which constrained the Oriental in \"dominating frameworks\" and disliking the usage of few Arabic words from the Fremen lexicon in the film.[239]Misha Grifka Wander has shown how the film downplays ecology and elements fromMENAcultures in favor of the chosen one storytelling trope.[240]Doru Pop discussed the controversies and changes made in the adaptation ofDuneto film andIsaac Asimov'sFoundationto atelevision series, particularly the gender and racial changes to key characters.[241]Ion Indolean looked at how Villeneuve cinematographically expresses the story of Paul using elements of thespace operagenre and follows in the steps of directorRidley ScottinBlade Runner(1982) andAlien(1979).[242]\n\nVilleneuve intended to make a two-part adaptation of the novel, and by November 2019,Jon Spaihtsleft his position as showrunner onDune: Prophecyto focus on writing the sequel film.[37][243]Villeneuve felt that Warner Bros.' decision in December 2020 to simultaneously release their 2021 films throughHBO Maxalongside a theatrical release due to theimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinemacould compromise the film's financial performance, resulting in the cancellation of the sequel, though Warner Bros. assured him a sequel would be greenlit as long as the film performed well on HBO Max.[154]\n\nFollowing the film's success, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures officially greenlitDune: Part Twoin October 2021.[244][245]Villeneuve's main concern was to finish the production, which would benefit from all the work on the first part.[244]Main characters reprise their role from the first film, with additional casting lasting from March to July 2022, and concluding by January 2023.[246]Preliminary filming began in Italy by early July 2022, and concluded that December.[247][248]The film was released on March 1, 2024.[249]Dune: Part Two's world premiere took place atOdeon Luxe Leicester Squarein London on February 15.[250][251]\n\nVilleneuve expressed interest in making a third film based onDune Messiah, the second novel in the series, adding that the possibility for the film depended on the success ofDune: Part Two.[252][253]Spaihts also reiterated in March 2022 that Villeneuve had plans for a third film as well as the television spin-off seriesDune: Prophecy.[254]In August 2023, Villeneuve declared his intentions for the film to serve as the conclusion of hisDunetrilogy.[255]Villeneuve began developing a script by 2023.[256]In February 2024, Villeneuve said the script was \"almost finished\" but also wanted to take time to ensure his satisfaction, citing Hollywood's tendency of focusing on release dates over quality.[257]Ahead ofDune: Part Two's release,Hans Zimmerrevealed he was already writing music for a third film.[258]\n\nIn June 2019,Legendary Televisionannounced it is producing a spin-off series,Dune: The Sisterhood, forWarnerMedia's streaming service,HBO Max. The series serves as a prequel to the film and centers on theBene Gesserit. Initially, Villeneuve was going to direct the series' pilot, with Spaihts writing the screenplay and Dana Calvo as showrunner for the series.[259][260]In November 2019, Spaihts left the series as writer to focus on the sequel film.[243]Spaihts and Villeneuve remain as executive producers along with Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, and Kim Herbert.[261]In July 2021, Diane Ademu-John took over as showrunner.[262]Spaihts and Villeneuve confirmed in March 2022 that the show is still in development.[254]In April 2022, it was announced thatJohan Renckwill direct the first two episodes.[263]Travis Fimmeljoined the cast in November 2022.[264]In February 2023, it was announced that production was put on hiatus as Renck exited the project.[265]The series was retitledDune: Prophecyin November 2023.[266]",

Herbert wrote five sequels, the first two of which were concomitantly adapted as a2003 miniseries.Dunehas also inspiredtabletop gamesand aseries of video games. Since 2009, the names of planets from theDunenovels have been adopted for the real-worldnomenclatureof plains and other features onSaturn's moonTitan.\n\nFrank Herbert died in 1986. Beginning in 1999, his sonBrian Herbertand science fiction authorKevin J. Andersonpublished several collections of prequel novels, as well as two sequels that complete the originalDuneseries (Hunters of Dunein 2006 andSandworms of Dunein 2007), partially based on Frank Herbert's notes discovered a decade after his death.[3][4][5]As of 2024, 23Dunebooks by Herbert and Anderson have been published.\n\nThe political, scientific, and social fictional setting of Herbert's novels and derivative works is known as theDuneuniverseorDuniverse. Set tens of thousands of years in the future, the saga chronicles a civilization that has banned all \"thinking machines\", which include computers,robots, andartificial intelligence. In their place, civilization has developed advanced mental and physical disciplines as well as advanced technologies that adhere to the ban on computers. Vital to this empire is the harshdesert planetArrakis, the only known source of the spicemelange, the most valuable substance in the universe.\n\nFor the similarities between some of Herbert's terms and ideas and actual words and concepts in theArabic language, as well as the series' \"Islamicundertones\" and themes, aMiddle Easterninfluence in Herbert's works has been widely noted.\n\nTheDunesaga is set thousands of years in humanity's future.Faster-than-lighttravel has been developed, and humans havecolonizeda vast number of worlds. However, a great reaction against computers has resulted in a ban on any \"thinking machine\", with the creation or possession of suchpunishable by immediate death. Despite this prohibition, humanity continues to develop and advance other branches of technology, includingextrasensory perception(ESP) and instruments of war. At the time of the first book's setting, humanity has formed afeudalinterstellar empireknown as the Imperium, run by several Great Houses that oversee various planets. Of key interest is the planetArrakis, known to the native population as \"Dune\". Adesert planetwith barely anyprecipitation, it is the only planet where a special life-extending drug,melange(or \"the spice\"), can be found. In addition to life extension, melange enhances the mental capacity of humans throughprescience, allowing theSpacing Guildpilots (mutated by heavy melange use) to navigatefolded spaceand travel the distances between planets; and triggers some of the powers of theBene Gesserit, a religious group that secretly seeks to control the direction humanity takes. Melange is challenging to acquire due to the harsh environment of Arrakis, and the presence of giantsandwormsthat are drawn towards any rhythmic sounds on the sands of the desert. Feudal control over thefiefdomArrakis, its spice production, and the impact on humanity's development become the centerpoints of a millennia-long conflict that develops through the series.\n\nTheDuneuniverse, set in the distant future of humanity, has a history that stretches thousands of years (some 15,000 years in total) and covers considerable changes in political, social, and religious structure as well as technology. Creative works set in theDuneuniverse can be said to fall into five general time periods:\n\nAs explained inDune, theButlerian Jihadis a conflict taking place over 11,000 years in the future[7](and over 10,000 years before the events ofDune), which results in the total destruction of virtually all forms of \"computers,thinking machines, andconscious robots\".[8]With the prohibition \"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind,\" the creation of even the simplest thinking machines is outlawed and madetaboo,[8]which has a profound influence on thesocio-politicaland technological development of humanity in theDuneseries.[9]Herbert refers to the Jihad several times in the novels, but does not give much detail on how he imagined the causes and nature of the conflict.[10]Critical analysis has often associated the term withSamuel Butlerand his 1863 essay \"Darwin among the Machines\", which advocated the destruction of all advanced machines.[11]\n\nIn Herbert'sGod Emperor of Dune(1981),Leto II Atreidesindicates that the Jihad had been a semi-religious social upheaval initiated by humans who felt repulsed by how guided and controlled they had become by machines.[12]This technological reversal leads to the creation of the universalOrange Catholic Bibleand the rise of a newfeudalpan-galactic empire that lasts for over 10,000 years before Herbert's series begins.[13][14]Severalsecret societiesalso develop, usingeugenicsprograms, intensive mental and physical training, and pharmaceutical enhancements to hone human skills to an astonishing degree.[13]Artificial inseminationis also prohibited, as explained inDune Messiah(1969), whenPaul Atreidesnegotiates with theReverend MotherGaius Helen Mohiam, who is appalled by Paul's suggestion that he impregnate his consort in this manner.[15]\n\nHerbert died in 1986,[16][17]leaving his vision of the events of the Butlerian Jihad unexplored and open to speculation.[10]TheLegends of Duneprequel trilogy (2002–2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson presents the Jihad as a war between humans and thesentient machinesthey had created, who rise up and nearly destroy humanity.[18]The series explains that humanity had become entirely complacent and dependent upon thinking machines; recognizing this weakness, a group of ambitious, militant humans calling themselves theTitansuse this widespread reliance on machine intelligence to seize control of the entire universe.[18]Their reign lasts for a century; eventually they give too much access and power to theAIprogramOmnius, which usurps control from the Titans themselves.[10][18]Seeing no value in human life, the thinking machines—now including armies of robot soldiers and other aggressive machines—dominate and enslave nearly all of humanity in the universe for 900 years, until a jihad is ignited.[10]This crusade against the machines lasts for almost a century, with much loss of human life but ultimately ending in human victory.[18]\n\nThe ancientBattle of Corrin—occurring 20 years after the end of the Butlerian Jihad—spawns thePadishah Emperorsof House Corrino, who rule the known universe for millennia by controlling theSardaukar, a brutally efficient military force. Ten thousand years later, Imperial power is balanced by the assembly of noble houses called theLandsraad, which enforces theGreat Convention's ban on the use ofatomicsagainst human targets. Though the power of the Corrinos is unrivaled by any individual House, they are in constant competition with each other for political power and stakes in the omnipresentCHOAMcompany, a directorship that controls the wealth of the entire Empire. The third primary power in the universe is theSpacing Guild, which monopolizesinterstellar traveland banking. MutatedGuild Navigatorsuse the spice drugmelangeto successfully navigate \"folded space\" and safely guide enormousheighlinerstarshipsfrom planet to planet instantaneously.[13][19]\n\nThematriarchalBene Gesseritpossesses almost superhuman physical, sensory, and deductive powers developed through years of physical and mental conditioning. While positioning themselves to \"serve\" humanity, the Bene Gesserit pursue their goal to better the human race by subtly and secretly guiding and manipulating the affairs of others to serve their own purposes. By the time ofDune, they have secured a level of control over the current emperor,Shaddam IV, by marrying him to one of their own who intentionally bears him only daughters. The Bene Gesserit also has a secret, millennia-long selectivebreeding programto bolster and preserve valuable skills and bloodlines as well as to produce a theoretical superhuman male they call theKwisatz Haderach. WhenDunebegins, the Sisterhood is only one generation away from their desired individual, having manipulated the threads of genes and power for thousands of years to produce the required confluence of events. ButLady Jessica, ordered by the Bene Gesserit to produce a daughter who would breed with the appropriate male to make the Kwisatz Haderach, instead bears a son—unintentionally producing the Kwisatz Haderach a generation early.[13]\n\n\"Human computers\" known asMentatshave been developed and perfected to replace the capacity for logical analysis lost through the prohibition of computers. Through specific training, they learn to enter a heightened mental state in which they can perform complex logical computations that are superior to those of the ancient thinking machines.[20]TheBene Tleilaxare amoral merchants who traffic in biological andgenetically engineeredproducts such as artificial eyes, \"twisted\" Mentats, andgholas. Finally, the Ixians producecutting-edgetechnology that seemingly complies with (but pushes the boundaries of) the prohibitions against thinking machines. The Ixians are very secretive, not only to protect their valuable hold on the industry but also to hide any methods or inventions that may breach the anti-thinking machine protocols.[13]\n\nAgainst this backdrop, thePrelude to Duneprequel trilogy (1999–2001) chronicles the return from obscurity of House Atreides, whose role in the Butlerian Jihad is all but forgotten. The Imperial House schemes to gain full control of the Empire through the control of melange, precisely at the time that the Bene Gesserit breeding program is nearing fruition.[21]\n\nAs Frank Herbert'sDune(1965) begins, DukeLeto Atreidesfinds himself in a dangerous position. The 81st Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV, has put him in control of thedesert planetArrakis, known as Dune, which is the only source of the all-important spice melange.[22]The most valuable commodity in the known universe, the spice not only makes safe and reliable interstellar travel possible, but also prolongs life, protects against disease, and is used by the Bene Gesserit to enhance their abilities. The potential financial gains for House Atreides are mitigated by the fact that mining melange from the desert surface of Arrakis is an expensive and hazardous undertaking, thanks to the treacherous environment and constant threat of giantsandwormsthat protect the spice. In addition, Leto is aware that Shaddam, feeling threatened by the rising power and influence of the Atreides, has sent him into a trap. Failure to meet or exceed the production volume of his predecessor, the villainous BaronVladimir Harkonnen, will harm the position of House Atreides in CHOAM, which relies on spice profits.[13]Further, the very presence of the Atreides on Arrakis inflames the long-simmeringWar of Assassinsbetween House Atreides and House Harkonnen, a feud ignited 10,000 years before when an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Butlerian Jihad.[23][24]\n\nThe little-understood native population of Arrakis are theFremen, long overlooked by the Imperium. Considered backward savages, the Fremen are extremely hardy people and exist in large numbers; their culture is built around the commodity of water, which is extremely scarce on Arrakis. The Fremen await the coming of a prophesiedmessiah, not suspecting that this prophecy had been planted in their legends by theMissionaria Protectiva, an arm of the Bene Gesserit dedicated to religious manipulation to ease the path of the Sisterhood when necessary. InDune, the so-called \"Arrakis Affair\" puts unexpected Kwisatz HaderachPaul Atreidesin control of first the Fremen people and then Arrakis itself. Absolute control over the spice supply allows Paul to depose Shaddam and become ruler of the known universe, with Shaddam's eldest daughterPrincess Irulanas his wife.[13]With a bloodyjihadsubsequently unleashed across the universe in Paul's name but out of his control, the Bene Gesserit, Tleilaxu, Spacing Guild, and House Corrino conspire to dethrone him inDune Messiah(1969).[15]Though the plot fails, the Atreides Empire continues to devolve inChildren of Dune(1976) as the religion built around Paul falters, Irulan's sisterWensiciaconspires to place her sonFarad'non the throne, and Paul's twin heirsLeto IIandGhanimarise to power.[25]\n\nTheHeroes of Duneseries (2008–2009) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson chronicles the major events that take place betweenDune: House Corrino(2001) andDune: The Duke of Caladan(2020), betweenDune(1965) andDune Messiah(1969), and betweenDune MessiahandChildren of Dune(1976).[26]\n\nAt the time ofGod Emperor of Dune(1981), Paul's son, the God Emperor Leto II Atreides, has ruled the Empire for 3,500 years from the verdant face of a transformed Arrakis; melange production has ceased. Leto has forced the sandworms into extinction, except for the larvalsandtroutwith which he had forged asymbiosis, transforming him into a human-sandworm hybrid. Human civilization before his rule had suffered from twin weaknesses: that a single authority could control it and that it was dependent upon melange, found on only one planet in the known universe. Leto's prescient visions had shown that humanity would be threatened by extinction in any number of ways; his solution was to place humanity on his \"Golden Path,\" a plan for humanity's survival. Leto governs as a benevolent tyrant, providing for his people's physical needs, but denying them any spiritual outlets other than his compulsory religion (as well as maintaining a monopoly on spice and thus total control of its use). Personal violence is banned, as is nearly all space travel, creating a pent-up demand for freedom and travel. The Bene Gesserit, Ixians, and Tleilaxu seek ways to regain some of their former power or unseat Leto altogether. Leto also conducts his selective breeding program among the descendants of his twin sister Ghanima, finally arriving atSiona, daughter ofMoneo, whose actions are hidden from prescient vision. Leto engineers his own assassination, knowing it will result in rebellion and revolt but also in an explosion in travel and colonization. The death of Leto's body also produces new sandtrout, which will eventually give rise to a population of sandworms and a new cycle of spice production.[27]\n\nIn the aftermath of the fall of the God Emperor, chaos and severe famine in many worlds caused trillions of humans to set off into the freedom of unknown space and spread out across the universe. Thisdiasporais later calledthe Scatteringand, combined with the invisibility of Atreides descendants to prescient vision, assures that humanity has forever escaped the threat of total extinction. At the time ofHeretics of Dune(1984) andChapterhouse: Dune(1985)—1500 years after Leto's death—the turmoil is settling into a new pattern; the balance of power in the Old Empire, as it is now called, rests among the Ixians, the Bene Gesserit, and the Tleilaxu. The Spacing Guild has been forever weakened by the development of Ixian machines capable of navigation in foldspace, practically replacing Guild Navigators. The Bene Gesserit, through manipulation of the Priesthood of the Divided God, control the sandworms and their planet, now called Rakis, but the Tleilaxu have discovered how to produce melange using their axlotl tanks in quantities that greatly exceed natural melange harvests. This balance of power is shattered by a large influx of people from the Scattering, some fleeing persecution by an as-yet-unknown enemy. Among the returning people, the Bene Gesserit finds its match in a violent and corrupt matriarchal society known as theHonored Matres, who they suspect may be descended from some of their own sent out in the Scattering. As a bitter and bloody war erupts between the orders, it ultimately becomes clear that joining the two organizations into a singleNew Sisterhoodwith shared abilities is their best chance to fight the approaching enemy.[28][29]\n\nThe sequelsHunters of Dune(2006) andSandworms of Dune(2007) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson complete the original series and wrap up storylines that began withHeretics of Dune.\n\nHerbert's interest in the desert setting ofDuneand its challenges is attributed to research he began in 1957 for a never-completed article about aUnited States Department of Agricultureexperiment usingpoverty grassto stabilize damaging sanddunes, which could \"swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, and highways.\"[30]Herbert spent the next five years researching, writing, and revising what would eventually become the novelDune,[30]which was initially serialized inAnalogmagazine as two shorter works,Dune World(1963) andThe Prophet of Dune(1965).[31]The serialized version was expanded and reworked—and rejected by more than 20 publishers—before being published byChilton Books, a printing house best known for its auto repair manuals, in 1965.[32]Dunewon the inauguralNebula Award for Best Novelin 1966, and the 1966Hugo Award.[33][34]The novel has been translated into dozens of languages, and has sold almost 20 million copies.[35]Dunehas been regularly cited as one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.[1][2]\n\nA sequel,Dune Messiah, followed in 1969.[36]A third novel calledChildren of Dunewas published in 1976, and was later nominated for a Hugo Award.[37]Children of Dunebecame the first hardcover best-seller ever in the science fiction field.[38]Parts of these two first sequels were written beforeDunewas completed.[39]\n\nIn 1978,PutnampublishedThe Illustrated Dune, an edition ofDunewith 33 black-and-white sketch drawings and eight full color paintings byJohn Schoenherr, who had done the cover art for the first printing ofDuneand had illustrated theAnalogserializations ofDuneandChildren of Dune.[40]Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author was surprised to find that the artwork appeared exactly as he had imagined its fictional subjects, includingsandworms,Baron Harkonnenand theSardaukar.[41]\n\nIn 1981, Herbert releasedGod Emperor of Dune, which was ranked as the #11 hardcover fiction best seller of 1981 byPublishers Weekly.[42]Heretics of Dune, the 1984New York Times#13 hardcover fiction best seller,[43]was followed in quick succession byChapterhouse: Dunein 1985.[44]Herbert died on February 11, 1986.[16]\n\nOver a decade after Herbert's death, his son Brian Herbert enlisted science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson to coauthor atrilogyofDuneprequelnovels that would come to be called thePrelude to Duneseries.[45]Using some of Frank Herbert's own notes,[45][46]the duo wroteDune: House Atreides(1999),Dune: House Harkonnen(2000), andDune: House Corrino(2001). The series is set in the years immediately prior to the events ofDune. This was followed with a second prequel trilogy called theLegends of Dune, consisting ofDune: The Butlerian Jihad(2002),Dune: The Machine Crusade(2003), andDune: The Battle of Corrin(2004). These were set during theButlerian Jihad, an element ofbackstorythat Frank Herbert had previously established as occurring 10,000 years before the events chronicled inDune.[10]Herbert's brief description of humanity's \"crusade againstcomputers,thinking machines, andconscious robots\"[8]was expanded by Brian Herbert and Anderson in this series.[10]\n\nWith an outline for the first book ofPrelude to Duneseries written and a proposal sent to publishers,[47]Brian Herbert had discovered his father's 30-page outline for a sequel toChapterhouse Dune, which the elder Herbert had dubbedDune 7.[48]After publishing their six prequel novels, Brian Herbert and Anderson releasedHunters of Dune(2006) andSandworms of Dune(2007), which complete the original series and wrap up storylines that began with Frank Herbert'sHeretics of Dune.\n\nTheHeroes of Duneseries followed, focusing on the time periods between Frank Herbert's original novels.[45][49][50][51]The first book,Paul of Dune, was published in 2008,[52]followed byThe Winds of Dune[50][53]in 2009.[54]The next two installments were to be calledThe Throne of DuneandLeto of Dune(possibly changing toThe Golden Path of Dune),[55]but were postponed due to plans to publish a trilogy,Great Schools of Dune, about \"the formation of the Bene Gesserit, the Mentats, theSuk doctors, the Spacing Guild and the Navigators, as well as the solidifying of the Corrino Imperium.\"[56]Sisterhood of Dunewas released in 2012,[56]followed byMentats of Dunein 2014. In a 2009 interview, Anderson stated that the third and final novel would be titledThe Swordmasters of Dune,[48]but by 2014 it had been renamedNavigators of Dune.[57]The novel was published on September 13, 2016.[58]A thirdHeroes of Dunenovel,Princess of Dune, was released on October 3, 2023.[59]\n\nIn July 2020, Herbert and Anderson announced a new trilogy of prequel novels calledThe Caladan Trilogy. The first novel in the series,Dune: The Duke of Caladan, was published in October 2020,[60][61]and the second,Dune: The Lady of Caladan, was released in September 2021.[62][63]The third novel,Dune: The Heir of Caladan, was released on November 22, 2022.[64]\n\nIn 1985, Frank Herbert wrote an illustrated short work called \"The Road to Dune\", set sometime between the events ofDuneandDune Messiah. Published in Herbert'sshort story collectionEye, it takes the form of a guidebook for pilgrims toArrakisand features images (with descriptions) of some of the devices and characters presented in the novels.[65]\n\nBrian Herbert and Anderson have written eightDuneshort storiesand fourDunenovellas, most of them related to and published around their novels. The eight short stories include \"Dune: A Whisper of Caladan Seas\" (2001), \"Dune: Hunting Harkonnens\" (2002), \"Dune: Whipping Mek\" (2003), \"Dune: The Faces of a Martyr\" (2004), \"Dune: Sea Child\" (2006), \"Dune: Treasure in the Sand\" (2006), \"Dune: Wedding Silk\" (2008), and \"Dune: Red Plague\" (2016). These eight short stories were published together in the 2017 collectionTales of Dune: Expanded Edition. The four novellas include \"Dune: The Waters of Kanly\" (2017), \"Dune: Blood of the Sardaukar\" (2019), \"Dune: The Edge of a Crysknife\" (2022), and \"Dune: Imperial Court\" (2022). The four novellas were published together in the collectionSands of Dune, which released on July 28, 2022.\n\nIn 1984, Herbert's publisher Putnam releasedThe Dune Encyclopedia.[66][67]Approved by Herbert but not written by him, this collection of essays by 43 contributors describes in invented detail many aspects of theDuneuniverse not found in the novels themselves.[68]Herbert's estate later confirmed its non-canonicalstatus after Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson had begun publishing prequel novels that directly contradictThe Dune Encyclopedia.[69]The 1984DunefilmspawnedThe Dune Storybook(September 1984,ISBN0-399-12949-9), anovelizationwritten byJoan D. Vinge,[67][70]andThe Making of Dune(December 1984,ISBN0-425-07376-9), amaking-ofbook byEd Naha.[67][71]\n\nIn May 1992,Ace BookspublishedSongs of Muad'Dib(ISBN0-441-77427-X), a collection ofDune-related poems written by Frank Herbert and edited by his son Brian.[67][72]Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson releasedThe Road to Duneon August 11, 2005. The book contains a novelette calledSpice Planet(an alternative version ofDunebased on an outline by Frank Herbert), a number of the Brian Herbert/Anderson short stories, and letters and unused chapters written by Frank Herbert.[73]In the 1999gazetteerThe Stars and Planets of Frank Herbert's Dune: A Gazetteer(1999), Joseph M. Daniels estimates the distance from Earth inlight-years(ly) for manyDuneplanets, based on the real-life distances of the stars andplanetary systemsreferenced by Frank Herbert when discussing these planets in the glossary of the novelDune. Though Herbert used the names of actual stars and planetary systems in his work, there is no documentation supporting or disputing the assumption that he was, in fact, referring to these real-life stars or systems.[74]\n\nThe Science of Dune(2008) analyzes and deconstructs many of Herbert's concepts and fictional inventions.[75][76][77]\n\nTheDuneseries is a landmark ofsoft science fiction. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in hisDuneuniverse so he could address the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology.Duneconsiders the way humans and their institutions might change over time.[78]Jon Michaud ofThe New Yorkercalled the originating novelDune\"an epic of political betrayal, ecologicalbrinkmanship, and messianic deliverance.\"[22]DirectorJohn Harrison, who adaptedDuneforSyfy's2000 miniseries, called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of \"the human condition and its moral dilemmas\", and said:\n\nA lot of people refer toDuneas science fiction. I never do. I consider it an epic adventure in the classic storytelling tradition, a story of myth and legend not unlike theMorte d'Arthuror any messiah story. It just happens to be set in the future... The story is actually more relevant today than when Herbert wrote it. In the 1960s, there were just these two colossal superpowers duking it out. Today we're living in a more feudal, corporatized world more akin to Herbert's universe of separate families, power centers and business interests, all interrelated and kept together by the one commodity necessary to all.[79]\n\nNovelistBrian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son and biographer, explained that \"Frank Herbert drew parallels, used spectacular metaphors, and extrapolated present conditions into world systems that seem entirely alien at first blush. But close examination reveals they aren't so different from systems we know.\"[80]He wrote that the invaluable drugmelange\"represents, among other things, the finite resource of oil\".[80]Michaud explained, \"Imagine a substance with the combined worldwide value of cocaine and petroleum and you will have some idea of the power of melange.\"[22]Each chapter ofDunebegins with anepigraphexcerpted from the fictional writings of the characterPrincess Irulan. In forms such as diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context, and other details intended by Herbert to enhance understanding of his complex fictional universe and themes.[81]\n\nMichaud wrote in 2013, \"With daily reminders of the intensifying effects of global warming, the spectre of a worldwide water shortage, and continued political upheaval in the oil-rich Middle East, it is possible thatDuneis even more relevant now than when it was first published.\"[22]Praising Herbert's \"clever authorial decision\" to excise robots and computers (\"two staples of the genre\") from his fictional universe, he suggested that \"This de-emphasis on technology throws the focus back on people. It also allows for the presence of a religious mysticism uncommon in science fiction.\"[22]\n\nThe originating novelDunehas been called the \"first planetary ecology novel on a grand scale\".[82]After the publication ofSilent SpringbyRachel Carsonin 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences.Duneresponded in 1965 with its complex descriptions of life onArrakis, from giantsandworms(for whom water is life-threatening) to smaller, mouse-like life-forms adapted to live with limited water.Dunewas followed in its creation of complex and unique ecologies by other science fiction books such asA Door into Ocean(1986) andRed Mars(1992).[82]Environmentalists have pointed out thatDune'spopularity as a novel depicting a planet as a complex, almost living, thing, in combination with the first images of Earth from space being published in the same time period, strongly influenced environmental movements such as the establishment of the internationalEarth Day.[83]\n\nLorenzo DiTommaso comparedDune'sportrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire toEdward Gibbon'sThe History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which argues thatChristianityallied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall ofAncient Rome. In \"History and Historical Effect in Frank Herbert'sDune\" (1992), DiTommaso outlines similarities between the two works by highlighting the excesses ofPadishah EmperorShaddam IVon his home planet ofKaitainand of the BaronVladimir Harkonnenin his palace. The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and pomp. The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as \"parasites\". The Baron Harkonnen is similarly corrupt, materially indulgent, and a sexual degenerate. Gibbon'sDecline and Fallpartly blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity. Gibbon claimed that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to attack.\n\nSimilarly, the Emperor'sSardaukarfighters are little match for theFremenof Arrakis because of the Sardaukar's overconfidence and the Fremen's capacity for self-sacrifice. The Fremen put the community before themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury at the expense of others.[84]The decline and long peace of the Empire sets the stage for revolution and renewal by genetic mixing of successful and unsuccessful groups through war, a process culminating in the Jihad led byPaul Atreides, described by Herbert as depicting \"war as a collective orgasm\" (drawing on Norman Walter's 1950The Sexual Cycle of Human Warfare). These themes reappear inGod Emperor of Dune'sScatteringandLeto II Atreides's all-femaleFish Speakerarmy.[85][86]\n\nBrian Herbert wrote that \"Duneis a modern-day conglomeration of familiar myths, a tale in which great sandworms guard a precious treasure of melange...[that] resembles the myth described by an unknown English poet inBeowulf, the compelling tale of a fearsome fire dragon who guarded a great treasure hoard in a lair under cliffs.\"[80]\n\nPaul's rise to superhuman status follows thehero's journeytemplate; after unfortunate circumstances are forced onto him, he suffers a long period of hardship and exile, and finally confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale.[87][88]As such,Duneis representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means.[89]Frank Herbert said in 1979, \"The bottom line of theDunetrilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better [to] rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes.\"[90]He wrote in 1985, \"Dunewas aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question.\"[91]\n\nJuan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul's superpowers, differentiating the heroes ofDunefrom earlier heroes such asSuperman,van Vogt'sGilbert GosseynandHenry Kuttner's telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul's are the result of \"painful and slow personal progress.\" And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert's characters grow their powers through \"the application of mystical philosophies and techniques.\" For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen,Swordmasters of Ginazand Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Spacing Guild Navigators).[92]\n\nDue to the similarities between some of Herbert's terms and ideas and actual words and concepts inArabic, as well as the series' \"Islamicundertones\" and themes, aMiddle Easterninfluence on Herbert's works has been noted repeatedly.[93][94][95][96]\n\nAs a foreigner who adopts the ways of a desert-dwelling people and then leads them in a military capacity, Paul Atreides' character bears many similarities to the historicalT. E. Lawrence,[97]whose 1962 biopicLawrence of Arabiahas also been identified as an influence.[98]Lesley Blanch's novelThe Sabres of Paradise(1960) about Muslim resistance to theRussian conquest of the Caucasus, has also been identified as a major influence uponDune, with its depiction ofImam Shamil, theCaucasian Imamate, and the Islamic culture of theCaucasusinspiring some of the themes, characters, events and terminology ofDune.[99][100]Multiple proverbs recorded by Blanch'sThe Sabresas originating from the Caucasus Mountains are included inDune, such as \"polish comes from the city, wisdom from the hills,\" becoming \"polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert\" for Arrakis.[99]\n\nThe environment of the desert planet Arrakis is similar to the Middle East, particularly theArabian PeninsulaandPersian Gulf, as well as toMexico. The novel also contains references to the petroleum industries in theArab states of the Persian Gulfas well as Mexico.[101]The Fremen people of Arrakis were influenced by theBedouintribes of Arabia, and theMahdiprophecy originates fromIslamic eschatology.[102]Inspiration is also adopted from medieval historianibn Khaldun's cyclical history and hisdynastic conceptin North Africa, hinted by Herbert's reference to ibn Khaldun's bookKitāb al-ʿIbar\"The Book of Lessons\" as known among the Fremen.[103][104]\n\nIn addition to Arabic,Dunederives words and names from multiple other languages, includingHebrew,Navajo,Latin,Chakobsa, theNahuatllanguage of theAztecs,Greek,Persian,East Indian,Russian,Turkish,Finnish,DutchandOld English.[105]Herbert created a fictional language, also calledChakobsa, used by the Fremen on Arrakis for rituals and other purposes.[99]Through the inspiration from Lesley Blanch'sThe Sabres of Paradise, there are also allusions to the Tsarist-eraRussian nobilityandCossacks.[99]Herbert stated that bureaucracy that lasted long enough would become a hereditary nobility, and a significant theme behind the aristocratic families inDunewas \"aristocratic bureaucracy\" which he saw as analogous to theSoviet Union.[106][107]\n\nBrian Herbert called theDuneuniverse \"a spiritual melting pot\", noting that his father, Frank Herbert, incorporated elements of a variety of religions, includingBuddhism,Sufi mysticismand other Islamic belief systems,Catholicism,Protestantism,Judaism, andHinduism.[108]He added that Frank Herbert's fictional future in which \"religious beliefs have combined into interesting forms\" represents the author's solution to eliminating arguments between religions, each of which claim to have \"the one and only revelation.\"[108]Frank Herbert writes that, in the aftermath of the technology-purging Butlerian Jihad, the Bene Gesserit composed the Azhar Book, which \"preserves the great secrets of the most ancient faiths\".[109]Soon after, anecumenical councilcreated asyncreticreligion defined by theOrange Catholic Bible, which would become the primary orthodox religious text in the universe.[109]Its title suggests a merging of Protestantism (Orange Order) and Catholicism.[110][111]Herbert writes in the glossary ofDune:\n\nOrange Catholic Bible: the \"Accumulated Book,\" the religious text produced by the Commission of Ecumenical Translators. It contains elements of most ancient religions, including the Maometh Saari, Mahayana Christianity, Zensunni Catholicism and Buddislamic traditions. Its supreme commandment is considered to be: \"Thou shalt not disfigure the soul.\"[112]\n\nEarly in his newspaper career, Frank Herbert was introduced toZen, aschoolofMahayana Buddhism, by twoJungianpsychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, who \"gave a crucial boost to his thinking\".[113]Zen teachings ultimately had \"a profound and continuing influence on [Herbert's] work\".[113]Throughout theDuneseries and particularly inDune, Herbert employs concepts and forms borrowed from Zen Buddhism.[22][113][114]The Fremen areZensunniadherents, and many of Herbert's epigraphs are Zen-spirited.[115]In \"DuneGenesis\", Frank Herbert wrote:\n\nWhat especially pleases me is to see the interwoven themes, the fuguelike relationships of images that exactly replay the wayDunetook shape ... I involved myself with recurrent themes that turn into paradox. The central paradox concerns the human vision of time. What about Paul's gift of prescience—the Presbyterian fixation? For the Delphic Oracle to perform, it must tangle itself in a web ofpredestination. Yet predestination negates surprises and, in fact, sets up a mathematically enclosed universe whose limits are always inconsistent, always encountering the unprovable. It's like a koan, a Zen mind breaker.[41]\n\nThe Bene Gesserit practice \"religious engineering\" (social engineering), through theMissionaria Protectiva, which spreads contrived myths, prophecies and superstition on primitive worlds so that the Sisterhood may at a much later time exploit embedded belief to advance their universal strategies.[116]Herbert suggests a process of wish-fulfilling recognition of \"sacred\" texts created by the Bene Gesserit's master plan in a particular person, and transforming events intocommon belief.[117]In the novels, the Fremen religion on Arrakis has been thus influenced, allowing Paul to embody their prophesied messiah.[118]Paul is agonized by visions of terrible jihad which will destroy the Imperium, but he becomes Paul Muad'Dib,Mahdiof the Fremen, accepting the role imposed by Bene Gesserit. A new religion sweeps Paul to power.[90]\n\nBetween the events ofDuneandDune Messiah, the name Muad'Dib becomes a battle cry on the lips of the Fremen army that sweeps across the universe in a jihad in the name of Muad'Dib's religion.[119]The population of the universe sees Muad'Dib as their god, whether they like it or not, and they cannot deny his power religiously.[120]The Fremen culture is irreparably damaged by jihad; the new religion takes shape of rituals that are dependent on Muad'Dib'somnipresence.[90]As Muad'Dib, Paul is the messiah and the Emperor (King of Kings) who gives himself to fate and becomes a martyr to his followers, wanders blinded into the desert to die,[90]later finding emancipation as a heretic of his own church as the Preacher.[121]The regency of Paul's sisterAliaand the Qizarate priests continue to promote Muad'Dib's religion to help keep control of the universe, ensuring that others do not oppose them.[120]In hisGolden Path, Herbert presents an argument of how to create a healthy society, avoiding despotism and hero worship, a trap in which social groups can be caught:\n\nTo make a world where human kind can make its own future from moment to moment, free from one man's vision. Free from the perversion of the prophets words. And free of future pre-determined...[121]\n\nThepolitical,scientific, andsocialfictional settingof Herbert's novels and derivative works is known as theDuneuniverseorDuniverse.[77][122][123]Dunehas been widely influential, inspiring numerous novels, music, films, television, games, and comic books.[124]It is considered one of the greatest and most influential science fiction novels of all time, with numerous modern science fiction works such asStar Warsowing their existence toDune.[102]Dunehas also been referenced in numerous other works ofpopular culture, such asStar Trek,The Chronicles of Riddick,The Kingkiller Chronicle, andFuturama.[125]Dunewas cited as the prime inspiration forHayao Miyazaki'smanga, and laterfilm,Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind(1982–1994).[126]\n\nJon Michaud noted in 2013 inThe New Yorker, \"what's curious aboutDune'sstature is that it has not penetrated popular culture in the way thatThe Lord of the RingsandStar Warshave.\"[22]He praised Herbert's \"clever authorial decision\" to excise robots and computers (\"two staples of the genre\") from his fictional universe, but suggested that this may be one explanation whyDunelacks \"true fandom among science-fiction fans\".[22]\n\nSince 2009, the names of planets from theDunenovels have been adopted for the real-worldnomenclatureof plains (planitiae) and complexes of valleys (labyrinthi) onSaturn's moonTitan.[127][128][129]Planet names used to date includeArrakis,Caladan,Giedi Prime,Kaitain,Salusa Secundus, andTleilax.[128][129]TheHagal dune fieldand other sites onMarsare informally named after planets mentioned in theDuneseries.[130]The city ofTacoma, Washington, Herbert's birthplace, dedicated part ofPoint Defiance Parkas the \"DunePeninsula\" to honor the writer and the series.[131]\n\nIn 1973, director and writerAlejandro Jodorowskyset about creating a cinematic adaptation, taking over the option that producerArthur P. Jacobshad taken on the film adaptation rights in 1973 shortly before his death. Jodorowsky approached, among others,Peter Gabriel, the prog rock groupsPink FloydandMagmafor some of the music, artistsH. R. GigerandJean Giraudfor set and character design, andDan O'Bannonfor special effects. Jodorowsky cast his own sonBrontis Jodorowskyin the lead role of Paul Atreides,Salvador Dalías Shaddam IV, Padishah Emperor,Amanda Learas Princess Irulan,Orson Wellesas Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,Gloria Swansonas Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam,David Carradineas Duke Leto Atreides,Geraldine Chaplinas Lady Jessica,Alain Delonas Duncan Idaho,Hervé Villechaizeas Gurney Halleck,Udo Kieras Piter De Vries, andMick Jaggeras Feyd-Rautha.[132]He began writing a vast script, so expansive that the film was thought to potentially last 14 hours. The project was scrapped for financial reasons, leaving Jodorowsky's unfinished handwritten script in a notebook that was partially published as a facsimile in 2012 as part of the100 Notes – 100 Thoughtscatalog of the13thdocumentaexhibition.[133]Frank Pavichdirected a documentary about this unrealized project entitledJodorowsky's Dune, which premiered at the2013 Cannes Film Festivalin May 2013,[134]and was released theatrically in March 2014.[135]\n\nIn 1984,Dino De LaurentiisandUniversal PicturesreleasedDune, a feature film adaptation of the novel by director and writerDavid Lynch.[136]The film starsKyle MacLachlanas Paul Atreides,Jürgen Prochnowas Duke Leto Atreides,Francesca Annisas Lady Jessica,Sean Youngas Chani,Kenneth McMillanas Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,Siân Phillipsas Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam,Max von Sydowas Doctor Kynes,Stingas Feyd-Rautha,Freddie Jonesas Thufir Hawat,Richard Jordanas Duncan Idaho,Everett McGillas Stilgar,Patrick Stewartas Gurney Halleck,Dean Stockwellas Doctor Wellington Yueh, andJosé Ferreras Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.[137]Although a commercial and critical failure upon release, Frank Herbert himself was reportedly pleased with the film, as it stayed more faithful to the book than earlier film adaptation attempts. However, he had his reservations on its failures at the time, citing the lack of \"imagination\" in its marketing and estimated costs, and some of the filmmaker's production techniques.[91]In 2021, Ballyhoo Motion Pictures released a documentary entitledThe Sleeper Must Awaken: Making Dune. It chronicles the making of Lynch'sDunefilm. Initially intended to be released on a special feature for theArrow Films'Dunedisc release, it was later released on their paid streaming service Arrow Player.[138][139]\n\nIn 2008,Paramount Picturesannounced that it had a new feature film adaptation ofDunein development withPeter Bergset to direct;[140]Berg dropped out of the project in October 2009,[141]and directorPierre Morelwas signed in January 2010.[142]Paramount dropped the project in March 2011.[143][144]\n\nIn November 2016,Legendary Picturesacquired the film and TV rights forDune.[145][146]Varietyreported in December 2016 thatDenis Villeneuvewas in negotiations to directDune,[147]which was confirmed in February 2017.[148]In early 2018, Villeneuve stated that his goal was to adapt the novel into a two-part film series.[149]He said in May 2018 that the first draft of the script had been finished.[150][151]In July 2018, Brian Herbert confirmed that the latest draft of the screenplay covered \"approximately half of the novelDune.\"[152]Timothée Chalametwas cast to playPaul Atreides.[153]Greig Fraserjoined the project as cinematographer in December 2018.[154]In September 2018, it was reported thatRebecca Fergusonwas in talks to playJessica Atreides.[155]In January 2019,Dave Bautista[156]andStellan Skarsgård[157]joined the production, playingGlossu RabbanandVladimir Harkonnen, respectively.

    "content": "\n\nDuneis a 1965epicscience fictionnovel by American authorFrank Herbert, originally published as two separate serials (1963–64 novelDune Worldand 1965 novelProphet of Dune) inAnalogmagazine. It tied withRoger Zelazny'sThis Immortalfor theHugo Award for Best Noveland won the inauguralNebula Award for Best Novelin 1966. It is the first installment of theDune Chronicles. It is one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.[3]\n\nDuneis set in the distant future in afeudalinterstellar society, descended from terrestrial humans, in which various noble houses control planetaryfiefs.  It tells the story of youngPaul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planetArrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source ofmelange, or \"spice\", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.\n\nHerbert wrote fivesequels:Dune Messiah,Children of Dune,God Emperor of Dune,Heretics of Dune, andChapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert's death in 1986, his sonBrian Herbertand authorKevin J. Andersoncontinued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.\n\nAdaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmakerAlejandro Jodorowskyattempted to makea filmbased on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, afilm adaptationdirected byDavid Lynchwas released to mostly negative responses from critics and failure at the box office, although it later developed acult following. The book was also adapted into the 2000Sci-Fi ChannelminiseriesFrank Herbert's Duneand its 2003 sequel,Frank Herbert's Children of Dune(the latter of which combines the events ofDune MessiahandChildren of Dune). A secondfilm adaptation, directed byDenis Villeneuve, was released on October 21, 2021, to positive reviews. It grossed $434 million worldwide and went on to be nominated for tenAcademy Awards, includingBest Picture, ultimately winning six. Villeneuve's film covers roughly the first half of the original novel; asequel, which covers the second half of the story, was released on March 1, 2024, to critical acclaim and has grossed $711 million worldwide.\n\nThe series has also been used as the basis forseveral board, role-playing, and video games.\n\nSince 2009, the names of planets from theDunenovels have been adopted for the real-life nomenclature of plains and other features onSaturn's moonTitan.\n\nAfter his novelThe Dragon in the Seawas published in 1957, Herbert traveled toFlorence, Oregon, at the north end of theOregon Dunes. Here, theUnited States Department of Agriculturewas attempting to usepoverty grassesto stabilize thesand dunes. Herbert claimed in a letter to his literary agent,Lurton Blassingame, that the moving dunes could \"swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways.\"[4]Herbert's article on the dunes, \"They Stopped the Moving Sands\", was never completed (and only published decades later inThe Road to Dune), but its research sparked Herbert's interest in ecology and deserts.[5]\n\nHerbert further drew inspiration fromNative Americanmentors like \"Indian Henry\" (as Herbert referred to the man to his son; likely a Henry Martin of theHoh tribe) and Howard Hansen. Both Martin and Hansen grew up on theQuileutereservationnear Herbert's hometown. According to historianDaniel Immerwahr, Hansen regularly shared his writing with Herbert. \"White menare eating the earth,\" Hansen told Herbert in 1958, after sharing a piece on the effect of logging on the Quileute reservation. \"They're gonna turn this whole planet into a wasteland, just likeNorth Africa.\" The world could become a \"big dune,\" Herbert responded in agreement.[6]\n\nHerbert was also interested in the idea of thesuperheromystiqueandmessiahs. He believed thatfeudalismwas a natural condition humans fell into, where some led and others gave up the responsibility of making decisions and just followed orders. He found that desert environments have historically given birth to several major religions with messianic impulses. He decided to join his interests together so he could play religious and ecological ideas against each other. In addition, he was influenced by the story ofT. E. Lawrenceand the \"messianic overtones\" in Lawrence's involvement in theArab RevoltduringWorld War I. In an early version ofDune, the hero was actually very similar to Lawrence of Arabia, but Herbert decided the plot was too straightforward and added more layers to his story.[7]\n\nHerbert drew heavy inspiration also fromLesley Blanch'sThe Sabres of Paradise(1960), anarrative historyrecounting a mid-19th centuryconflict in the Caucasusbetween rugged caucasian Muslim tribes and the expandingRussian Empire.[8]Language used on both sides of that conflict become terms in Herbert's world—chakobsa, aCaucasianhunting language, becomes a battle language of humans spread across the galaxy;kanly, a word for blood feud in the 19th century Caucasus, represents a feud between Dune's noble Houses;sietchandtabirare both words for camp borrowed fromUkrainian Cossacks(of thePontic–Caspian steppe).[8]\n\nHerbert also borrowed some lines which Blanch stated were Caucasian proverbs.\"To kill with the point lacked artistry\", used by Blanch to describe the Caucasus peoples' love of swordsmanship, becomes in Dune\"Killing with the tip lacks artistry\", a piece of advice given to a young Paul during his training.\"Polish comes from the city, wisdom from the hills\", a Caucasianaphorism, turns into a desert expression:\"Polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert\".[8]\n\nAnother significant source of inspiration forDunewas Herbert's experiences withpsilocybinand his hobby of cultivating mushrooms, according tomycologistPaul Stamets's account of meeting Herbert in the 1980s:[9]\n\nFrank went on to tell me that much of the premise ofDune—the magicspice(spores) that allowed the bending of space (tripping), thegiant sand worms(maggotsdigesting mushrooms), the eyes of theFreman(theceruleanblue ofPsilocybemushrooms), the mysticism of the female spiritual warriors, theBene Gesserits(influenced by the tales ofMaria Sabinaand the sacred mushroom cults of Mexico)—came from his perception of the fungal life cycle, and his imagination was stimulated through his experiences with the use ofmagic mushrooms.\n\nHerbert spent the next five years researching, writing, and revising. He published a three-part serialDune Worldin the monthlyAnalog, from December 1963 to February 1964. The serial was accompanied by several illustrations that were not published again. After an interval of a year, he published the much slower-paced five-partThe Prophet of Dunein the January–May 1965 issues.[10][11]The first serial became \"Book One: Dune\" in the final publishedDunenovel, and the second serial was divided into \"Book Two: Muad'dib\" and \"Book Three: The Prophet\". The serialized version was expanded, reworked, and submitted to more than twenty publishers, each of whom rejected it. The novel,Dune, was finally accepted and published in August 1965 byChilton Books, a printing house better known for publishing auto repair manuals.[12]Sterling Lanier, an editor at Chilton, had seen Herbert's manuscript and had urged his company to take a risk in publishing the book. However, the first printing, priced at$5.95(equivalent to $57.53 in 2023), did not sell well and was poorly received by critics as being atypical of science fiction at the time. Chilton considered the publication ofDunea write-off and Lanier was fired.[13]Over the course of time, the book gained critical acclaim, and its popularity spread by word-of-mouth to allow Herbert to start working full time on developing the sequels toDune, elements of which were already written alongsideDune.[14]\n\nAt first Herbert considered usingMarsas setting for his novel, but eventually decided to use a fictional planet instead. His son Brian said that \"Readers would have too many preconceived ideas about that planet, due to the number of stories that had been written about it.\"[15]\n\nHerbert dedicated his work \"to the people whose labors go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'—to the dry-landecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration.\"[16]\n\nDukeLeto AtreidesofHouse Atreides, ruler of theocean worldCaladan, is assigned by thePadishah EmperorShaddam IVto serve as fief ruler of the planetArrakis. Although Arrakis is a harsh and inhospitabledesert planet, it is of enormous importance because it is the only planetary source ofmelange, or the \"spice\", a unique and incredibly valuable substance that extends human youth, vitality and lifespan. It is also through the consumption of spice thatSpacing GuildNavigators are able to effect safe interstellar travel by having limited ability to see the future. The Emperor is jealous of the Duke's rising popularity in theLandsraad, the council of Great Houses, and sees House Atreides as a potential future rival and threat. He conspires withHouse Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis and the longstanding enemies of the Atreides, to destroy Leto and his family after their arrival. Leto is aware his assignment is a trap of some kind but is compelled to obey the Emperor's orders anyway.\n\nLeto'sconcubineLady Jessicais an acolyte of theBene Gesserit, an exclusively female group that pursues mysterious political aims and wields seeminglysuperhumanphysical and mental abilities, such as the ability to control their bodies down to the cellular level, and also decide the sex of their children. Though Jessica was instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter as part of theirbreeding program, out of love for Leto she bore a son,Paul. From a young age, Paul is trained in warfare by Leto's aides, the elite soldiersDuncan IdahoandGurney Halleck.Thufir Hawat, the Duke'sMentat(human computers, able to store vast amounts of data and perform advanced calculations on demand), has instructed Paul in the ways of political intrigue. Jessica has also trained her son in Bene Gesserit disciplines.\n\nPaul'spropheticdreams interest Jessica's superior, theReverend MotherGaius Helen Mohiam. She subjects Paul to a deadly test. She holds a poisoned needle, thegom jabbar, to his neck, ready to strike should he withdraw his hand from a box which creates extreme pain by nerve induction but causes no physical damage. This is to test Paul's ability to endure the pain so as not to die on the tip of the needle; to confirm that his human strengths can overcome his animal instincts. Paul passes by enduring greater pain than any woman who has ever been subjected to the test.\n\nPaul and his parents travel with their household to occupyArrakeen, the capital on Arrakis formerly held by House Harkonnen. Leto learns of the dangers involved in harvesting the spice, which is protected by giantsandworms, and seeks to negotiate with the planet's indigenousFremenpeople, seeing them as a valuable ally rather than foes. Soon after the Atreides' arrival, Harkonnen forces attack, joined by the Emperor's ferociousSardaukartroops in disguise. Leto is betrayed by his personal physician, theSuk doctorWellington Yueh, who delivers a drugged Leto to the BaronVladimir Harkonnenand his twisted Mentat,Piter De Vries.\n\nYueh, who performed the kidnapping of Leto under duress, arranges for Jessica and Paul to escape into the desert. Duncan is killed helping them flee, and they are subsequently presumed dead in a sandstorm by the Harkonnens. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule, hoping Leto can kill the Baron during their encounter. Piter kills Yueh, and the Baron narrowly avoids the gas (due to his defensive shield), which kills Leto, Piter, and the others in the room. The Baron forces Thufir to take over Piter's position by dosing him with a long-lasting, fatal poison and threatening to withhold the regular antidote doses unless he obeys. While he follows the Baron's orders, Thufir works secretly to undermine the Harkonnens.\n\nHaving fled into the desert, Paul is exposed to high concentrations of spice and has visions through which he realizes he has significant powers (as a result of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme). He foresees potential futures in which he lives among the Fremen before leading them on aholy waracross the known universe. Paul reveals that Jessica is the daughter of the Baron, a secret kept from her by the Bene Gesserit.\n\nPaul and Jessica traverse the desert in search of Fremen people. After being captured by a Fremen band, Paul and Jessica agree to teach the Fremen the Bene Gesserit fighting technique known to the Fremen as the \"weirding way\" and are accepted into the community ofSietch Tabr. Paul proves his manhood by killing a Fremen man named Jamis in a ritualisticcrysknifefight and chooses the Fremen name Muad'Dib, while Jessica opts to undergo a ritual to become a Reverend Mother by drinking the poisonousWater of Life. Pregnant with Leto's daughter, she inadvertently causes the unborn child,Alia, to become infused with the same powers in the womb. Paul takes a Fremen lover,Chani, who bears him a son he names Leto.\n\nTwo years pass. Paul's powerful prescience manifests, which confirms for the Fremen that he is their prophesied \"Lisan al-Gaib\"messiah, a legend planted by the Bene Gesserit'sMissionaria Protectiva. Paul embraces his father's belief that the Fremen could be a powerful fighting force to take back Arrakis, but also sees that if he does not control them, theirjihadcould consume the entire universe. Word of the new Fremen leader reaches both the Baron and the Emperor as spice production falls due to their increasingly destructive raids. The Baron encourages his brutish nephewGlossu \"Beast\" Rabbanto rule with an iron fist, hoping the contrast with his shrewder nephewFeyd-Rauthawill make the latter popular among the people of Arrakis when he eventually replaces Rabban. The Emperor, suspecting the Baron of trying to create troops more powerful than the Sardaukar to seize power, sends spies to monitor activity on Arrakis. Thufir uses the opportunity to sow seeds of doubt in the Baron about the Emperor's true plans, putting further strain on their alliance.\n\nGurney, who survived the Harkonnen coup and became a smuggler, reunites with Paul and Jessica after a Fremen raid on his harvester. Believing Jessica to be a traitor, Gurney threatens to kill her but is stopped by Paul. Paul did not foresee Gurney's attack and concludes he must increase his prescience by drinking the Water of Life, which is traditionally fatal to males. Paul falls into unconsciousness for three weeks after drinking the poison, but when he wakes, he has clairvoyance across time and space: heistheKwisatz Haderach, the ultimate goal of the Bene Gesserit breeding program.\n\nPaul senses the Emperor and the Baron are amassing fleets around Arrakis to quell the Fremen rebellion, and prepares the Fremen for a major offensive against the Harkonnen troops. The Emperor arrives with the Baron on Arrakis. The Sardaukar seize a Fremen outpost, killing many including young Leto, while Alia is captured and taken to the Emperor. Under cover of an electric storm, which shorts out the Sardaukar's defensive shields, Paul and the Fremen, riding giant sandworms, destroy the capital's natural rock fortifications withatomicsand attack, while Alia assassinates the Baron and escapes. The Fremen quickly defeat both the Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops, killing Rabban in the process. Thufir is coerced to assassinate Paul, who, out of gratitude for the Mentat's service, gives him the opportunity to take anything that Thufir wishes of him. Thufir chooses to succumb to the poison instead.\n\nPaul faces the Emperor, threatening to destroy spice production forever unless Shaddam abdicates the throne. Feyd-Rautha attempts to stop Paul by challenging him to a ritualistic knife fight, during which he attempts to cheat and kill Paul with a poison spur in his belt. Paul gains the upper hand and kills him. The Emperor reluctantly cedes the throne to Paul and promises his daughterPrincess Irulan's hand in marriage. As Paul takes control of the Empire, he realizes that while he has achieved his goal, he is no longer able to stop the Fremen jihad, as their belief in him is too powerful to restrain.\n\nTheDuneseries is a landmark ofscience fiction. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in hisDuneuniverse so he could address the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology. For example, a key pre-history event to the novel's present is the \"Butlerian Jihad\", in which all robots and computers were destroyed, eliminating these common elements to science fiction from the novel as to allow focus on humanity.[14]Duneconsiders the way humans and their institutions might change over time.[1]DirectorJohn Harrison, who adaptedDuneforSyfy's2000 miniseries, called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of \"the human condition and its moral dilemmas\", and said:\n\nA lot of people refer toDuneas science fiction. I never do. I consider it an epic adventure in the classic storytelling tradition, a story of myth and legend not unlike theMorte d'Arthuror any messiah story. It just happens to be set in the future ... The story is actually more relevant today than when Herbert wrote it. In the 1960s, there were just these two colossal superpowers duking it out. Today we're living in a more feudal, corporatized world more akin to Herbert's universe of separate families, power centers and business interests, all interrelated and kept together by the one commodity necessary to all.[17]\n\nButDunehas also been called a mix ofsoftandhard science fictionsince \"the attention to ecology is hard, the anthropology and the psychic abilities are soft.\"[18]Hard elements include the ecology of Arrakis, suspensor technology, weapon systems, and ornithopters, while soft elements include issues relating to religion, physical and mental training, cultures, politics, and psychology.[19]\n\nHerbert said Paul's messiah figure was inspired by theArthurianlegend,[20]and that thescarcity of wateron Arrakis was a metaphor foroil, as well as air and water itself, and for the shortages of resources caused byoverpopulation.[21]NovelistBrian Herbert, his son and biographer, wrote:\n\nDuneis a modern-day conglomeration of familiar myths, a tale in which great sandworms guard a precious treasure of melange, the geriatric spice that represents, among other things, the finite resource of oil. The planet Arrakis features immense, ferocious worms that are like dragons of lore, with \"great teeth\" and a \"bellows breath of cinnamon.\" This resembles the myth described by an unknown English poet inBeowulf, the compelling tale of a fearsome fire dragon who guarded a great treasure hoard in a lair under cliffs, at the edge of the sea. The desert of Frank Herbert's classic novel is a vast ocean of sand, with giant worms diving into the depths, the mysterious and unrevealed domain of Shai-hulud. Dune tops are like the crests of waves, and there are powerful sandstorms out there, creating extreme danger. On Arrakis, life is said to emanate from the Maker (Shai-hulud) in the desert-sea; similarly all life on Earth is believed to have evolved from our oceans. Frank Herbert drew parallels, used spectacular metaphors, and extrapolated present conditions into world systems that seem entirely alien at first blush. But close examination reveals they aren't so different from systems we know … and the book characters of his imagination are not so different from people familiar to us.[22]\n\nEach chapter ofDunebegins with anepigraphexcerpted from the fictional writings of the character Princess Irulan. In forms such as diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context and other details intended to enhance understanding of Herbert's complex fictional universe and themes.[23][24][25]They act as foreshadowing and invite the reader to keep reading to close the gap between what the epigraph says and what is happening in the main narrative.[26]The epigraphs also give the reader the feeling that the world they are reading about is epically distanced, since Irulan writes about an idealized image of Paul as if he had already passed into memory.[27]Brian Herbert wrote: \"Dad told me that you could follow any of the novel's layers as you read it, and then start the book all over again, focusing on an entirely different layer. At the end of the book, he intentionally left loose ends and said he did this to send the readers spinning out of the story with bits and pieces of it still clinging to them, so that they would want to go back and read it again.\"[28]\n\nDue to the similarities between some of Herbert's terms and ideas and actual words and concepts in theArabic language, as well as the series' \"Islamicundertones\" and themes, aMiddle-Easterninfluence on Herbert's works has been noted repeatedly.[29][30]In his descriptions of the Fremen culture and language, Herbert uses both authentic Arabic words and Arabic-sounding words.[31][32]For example, one of the names for the sandworm, Shai-hulud, is derived fromArabic:شيء خلود,romanized:šayʾ ḫulūd,lit.'immortal thing' orArabic:شيخ خلود,romanized:šayḫ ḫulūd,lit.'old man of eternity'.[33][32]The title of the Fremen housekeeper, the Shadout Mapes, is borrowed from theArabic:شادوف,romanized:šādūf, theEgyptianterm fora device used to raise water.[32]In particular, words related to the messianic religion of the Fremen, first implanted by the Bene Gesserit, are taken from Arabic, including Muad'Dib (fromArabic:مؤدب,romanized:muʾaddib,lit.'educator'), Lisan al-Gaib (fromArabic:لسان الغيب,romanized:lisān al-ġayb,lit.'voice of the unseen') Usul (fromArabic:أصول,romanized:ʾuṣūl,lit.'fundamental principles'), Shari-a (fromArabic:شريعة,romanized:šarīʿa,lit.'sharia; path'), Shaitan (fromArabic:شيطان,romanized:šayṭān,lit.'Shaitan; devil; fiend'), and jinn (fromArabic:جن,romanized:ǧinn,lit.'jinn; spirit; demon; mythical being').[29]It is likely Herbert relied on second-hand resources such as phrasebooks and desert adventure stories to find these Arabic words and phrases for the Fremen.[32]They are meaningful and carefully chosen, and help create an \"imagined desert culture that resonates with exotic sounds, enigmas, and pseudo-Islamic references\" and has a distinctlyBedouinaesthetic.[32]\n\nAs a foreigner who adopts the ways of a desert-dwelling people and then leads them in a military capacity, Paul Atreides bears many similarities to the historicalT. E. Lawrence.[34]His 1962 biopicLawrence of Arabiahas also been identified as a potential influence.[35]The Sabres of Paradise(1960) has also been identified as a potential influence uponDune, with its depiction ofImam Shamiland the Islamic culture of theCaucasusinspiring some of the themes, characters, events and terminology ofDune.[8]\n\nThe environment of the desert planet Arrakis was primarily inspired by the environments of theMiddle East. Similarly Arrakis as a bioregion is presented as a particular kind of political site. Herbert has made it resemble a desertifiedpetrostatearea.[36]The Fremen people of Arrakis were influenced by the Bedouin tribes ofArabia, and theMahdiprophecy originates fromIslamic eschatology.[37]Inspiration is also adopted from medieval historianIbn Khaldun's cyclical history and hisdynastic conceptinNorth Africa, hinted at by Herbert's reference to Khaldun's bookKitāb al-ʿibar(\"The Book of Lessons\"). The fictionalized version of the \"Kitab al-ibar\" inDuneis a combination of a Fremen religious manual and a desert survival book.[38][39]\n\nIn addition to Arabic,Dunederives words and names from a variety of other languages, includingNavajo,Latin,Dutch(\"Landsraad\"),Romani,Hebrew(\"Kefitzat haderech\", in Hebrew \"קפיצת הדרך\", meaning contracting of the path),Serbo-Croatian,Nahuatl,Greek,Persian,Sanskrit(\"prana bindu\", \"prajna\"),Russian,Turkish,Finnish, andOld English.[40][41]Bene Gesseritis part of the Latin legal phrasequamdiu se bene gesserit\"as long as he shall behave himself well\" seen in grants of certain offices (such as judgeships) meaning that the appointee shall remain in office so long as he shall not be guilty of abusing it. Some critics miss the connotation of the phrase, misled by the Latin future perfectgesserit, taking it over-literally (and adding an unwarranted passive) to mean \"it will have been well borne\", an interpretation which is not well supported by the Bene Gesserit doctrine in the story.[42][original research?]\n\nThrough the inspiration fromThe Sabres of Paradise, there are also allusions to the tsarist-eraRussian nobilityandCossacks.[43]Frank Herbert stated that bureaucracy that lasted long enough would become a hereditary nobility, and a significant theme behind thearistocraticfamilies inDunewas \"aristocratic bureaucracy\" which he saw as analogous to theSoviet Union.[44][45]\n\nDunehas been called the \"first planetaryecologynovel on a grand scale\".[46]Herbert hoped it would be seen as an \"environmental awarenesshandbook\" and said the title was meant to \"echo the sound of 'doom'\".[47]It was reviewed in the best selling counterculturalWhole Earth Catalogin 1968 as a \"rich re-readable fantasy with clear portrayal of the fierce environment it takes to cohere a community\".[48]\n\nAfter the publication ofSilent SpringbyRachel Carsonin 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences.Duneresponded in 1965 with its complex descriptions of Arrakis life, from giant sandworms (for whom water is deadly) to smaller, mouse-like life-forms adapted to live with limited water.Dunewas followed in its creation of complex and unique ecologies by other science fiction books such asA Door into Ocean(1986) andRed Mars(1992).[46]Environmentalists have pointed out thatDune'spopularity as a novel depicting a planet as a complex—almost living—thing, in combination with thefirst images of Earth from spacebeing published in the same time period, strongly influenced environmental movements such as the establishment of the internationalEarth Day.[49]\n\nWhile the genre ofclimate fictionwas popularized in the 2010s in response to real globalclimate change,Duneas well as other early science fiction works from authors likeJ. G. Ballard(The Drowned World) andKim Stanley Robinson(theMarstrilogy) have retroactively been considered pioneering examples of the genre.[50][51]\n\nThe Imperium inDunecontains features of various empires in Europe and theNear East, including theRoman Empire,Holy Roman Empire, andOttoman Empire.[52][33][53]Lorenzo DiTommaso comparedDune'sportrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire toEdward Gibbon'sDecline and Fall of the Roman Empire,which argues thatChristianityallied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall ofAncient Rome. In \"The Articulation of Imperial Decadence and Decline in Epic Science Fiction\" (2007), DiTommaso outlines similarities between the two works by highlighting the excesses of the Emperor on his home planet of Kaitain and of the Baron Harkonnen in his palace. The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and pomp. The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as \"parasites\". The Baron Harkonnen is similarly corrupt and materially indulgent. Gibbon'sDecline and Fallpartly blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity. Gibbon claimed that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to attack. The Emperor's Sardaukar fighters are little match for the Fremen of Dune not only because of the Sardaukar's overconfidence and the fact that Jessica and Paul have trained the Fremen in their battle tactics, but because of the Fremen's capacity for self-sacrifice. The Fremen put the community before themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury at the expense of others.[54]\n\nThe decline and long peace of the Empire sets the stage for revolution and renewal bygenetic mixingof successful and unsuccessful groups through war, a process culminating in the Jihad led by Paul Atreides, described by Frank Herbert as depicting \"war as a collective orgasm\" (drawing on Norman Walter's 1950The Sexual Cycle of Human Warfare),[55][56]themes that would reappear inGod Emperor of Dune'sScatteringand Leto II's all-femaleFish Speakerarmy.\n\nGender dynamicsare complex inDune. Herbert offers a multi-layered portrayal of gender roles within the context of a feudal, hierarchical society, particularly through the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. Although the Bene Gesserit tend to hold roles that are traditionally associated with women, such as wives, concubines, and mothers, their characters transcend stereotypes as they play politics and pursue long-term strategic goals. Full gender equality is not depicted inDune, but the Bene Gesserit use specialized training and access to high-ranking men to gain agency and power within the constraints of their environment. Their training in prana-bindu allows them to exert control over their minds and bodies, including over pregnancy, and they are skilled in hand-to-hand combat and use of the Voice to command others. Jessica's disobedience in bearing a son instead of daughter and training him in the Bene Gesserit Way is a major plot point that sets in motion the events of the novel.[57][58]By setting up certain women with leaders of certain Houses in the Imperium, the Bene Gesserit can control bloodlines across generations through their secret breeding program.[59]Even within the male-dominated Imperium, then, the Bene Gesserit wield reproductive power and choose which genetic markers to continue into the future.[60]\n\nReverend Mother Mohiam uses skills in Truthsaying to act as the Emperor's official Truthsayer and advisor. Her role can be considered similar to that ofabbessesin the medieval Church. Before Princess Irulan appears as a character who agrees to a political marriage with Paul, she acts as a historian who shapes the reader's interpretation of the story and Paul's legacy due to the excerpts from her writing that frame each chapter.[57][58]\n\nAmong the Fremen, women have roles as mothers and wives and also exercise agency through combat and religious authority. Fremen women and children have a reputation for being just as violent and dangerous as Fremen men. Chani travels with Stilgar in his military party, armed like the others. After becoming Paul's concubine, she kills one of the men who comes to challenge him. Alia leads an attack against the Emperor's Sardaukar and kills Baron Harkonnen with a gom jabbar. Women also take on the role of religious leaders. Chani is a Sayyadina who presides over tribal rituals such as Paul's worm-riding test, and Reverend Mother Ramallo carries the tribe's memories and passes them along to Jessica through theWater of Lifeceremony. Within the male-led sietches, Fremen women find different avenues of authority.[61]\n\nThe gom jabbar test of humanity is administered by the female Bene Gesserit order but rarely to males.[62]The Bene Gesserit have seemingly mastered the unconscious and can play on the unconscious weaknesses of others using the Voice, yet their breeding program seeks after a male Kwisatz Haderach.[34]Their plan is to produce a male who can \"possess complete racial memory, both male and female,\" and look into the black hole in the collective unconscious that they fear.[63]A central theme of the book is the connection, in Jessica's son, of this female aspect with his male aspect. This aligns with concepts inJungianpsychology, which features conscious/unconscious and taking/giving roles associated with males and females, as well as the idea of the collective unconscious.[64]Paul's approach to power consistently requires his upbringing under the matriarchal Bene Gesserit, who operate as a long-dominatingshadow governmentbehind all of the great houses and their marriages or divisions.[63]He is trained by Jessica in the Bene Gesserit Way, which includes prana-bindu training in nerve and muscle control and precise perception.[58]Paul also receives Mentat training, thus helping prepare him to be a type of androgynous Kwisatz Haderach, a male Reverend Mother.[63]\n\nIn a Bene Gesserit test early in the book, it is implied that people are generally \"inhuman\" in that they irrationally place desire over self-interest and reason.[citation needed]This applies Herbert's philosophy that humans are not created equal, while equal justice and equal opportunity are higher ideals than mental, physical, or moral equality.[65]\n\nI am showing you the superhero syndrome and your own participation in it.\n\nThroughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, he follows a plotline common to manystories describing the birth of a hero.[67]He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him. After a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale.[68][69]As such,Duneis representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means.[70]Eventually, Paul Atreides gains a level of omniscience which allows him to take over the planet and the galaxy, and causes the Fremen of Arrakis to worship him like a god. Author Frank Herbert said in 1979, \"The bottom line of theDunetrilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better to rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes.\"[71]He wrote in 1985, \"Dunewas aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question.\"[72]\n\nJuan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul's superpowers, differentiating the heroes ofDunefrom earlier heroes such asSuperman,van Vogt'sGilbert GosseynandHenry Kuttner's telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul's are the result of \"painful and slow personal progress.\" And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert's characters grow their powers through \"the application of mystical philosophies and techniques.\" For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen, Ginaz swordsmen and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Spacing Guild Navigators).[73]\n\nEarly in his newspaper career, Herbert was introduced toZenby twoJungianpsychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, who \"gave a crucial boost to his thinking\".[74]Zen teachings ultimately had \"a profound and continuing influence on [Herbert's] work\".[74]Throughout theDuneseries and particularly inDune, Herbert employs concepts and forms borrowed fromZen Buddhism.[74][75]The Fremen are referred to asZensunniadherents, and many of Herbert's epigraphs are Zen-spirited.[76]In \"DuneGenesis\", Frank Herbert wrote:\n\nWhat especially pleases me is to see the interwoven themes, the fugue like relationships of images that exactly replay the wayDunetook shape. As in anEscherlithograph, I involved myself with recurrent themes that turn into paradox. The central paradox concerns the human vision of time. What about Paul's gift of prescience - thePresbyterianfixation? For theDelphic Oracleto perform, it must tangle itself in a web ofpredestination. Yet predestination negates surprises and, in fact, sets up a mathematically enclosed universe whose limits are always inconsistent, always encountering the unprovable. It's like akoan, a Zen mind breaker. It's like theCretanEpimenidessaying, \"All Cretans are liars.\"[65]\n\nBrian Herbert called theDuneuniverse \"a spiritual melting pot\", noting that his father incorporated elements of a variety of religions, includingBuddhism,Sufi mysticismand other Islamic belief systems,Catholicism,Protestantism,Judaism, andHinduism.[77]He added that Frank Herbert's fictional future in which \"religious beliefs have combined into interesting forms\" represents the author's solution to eliminating arguments between religions, each of which claimed to have \"the one and only revelation.\"[77][78]\n\nTim O'Reilly suggests that Herbert also wroteDuneas a counterpoint toIsaac Asimov'sFoundationseries. In hismonographon Frank Herbert, O'Reilly wrote that \"Duneis clearly a commentary on theFoundationtrilogy. Herbert has taken a look at the same imaginative situation that provoked Asimov's classic—the decay of a galactic empire—and restated it in a way that draws on different assumptions and suggests radically different conclusions. The twist he has introduced intoDuneis thatthe Mule, not the Foundation, is his hero.\"[79]According to O'Reilly, Herbert bases the Bene Gesserit on the scientific shamans of the Foundation, though they use biological rather than statistical science.[79]In contrast to theFoundationseries and its praise of science and rationality,Duneproposes that the unconscious and unexpected are actually what are needed for humanity.[79]\n\nBoth Herbert and Asimov explore the implications of prescience (i.e., visions of the future) both psychologically and socially. TheFoundationseries deploys a broadly determinist approach to prescient vision rooted in mathematical reasoning on a macroscopic social level.Dune, by contrast, invents a biologically rooted power of prescience that becomes determinist when the user actively relies on it to navigate past an undefined threshold of detail. Herbert's eugenically produced and spice-enhanced prescience is also personalized to individual actors whose roles in later books constrain each other's visions, rendering the future more or less mutable as time progresses. In what might be a comment onFoundation, Herbert's most powerfully prescient being inGod Emperor of Dunelaments the boredom engendered by prescience, and values surprises, especially regarding one's death, as a psychological necessity.[citation needed]\n\nHowever, both works contain a similar theme of the restoration of civilization[80]and seem to make the fundamental assumption that \"political maneuvering, the need to control material resources, and friendship or mating bonds will be fundamentally the same in the future as they are now.\"[81]\n\nDunetied withRoger Zelazny'sThis Immortalfor theHugo Awardin 1966[82]and won the inauguralNebula Award for Best Novel.[83]Reviews of the novel have been largely positive, andDuneis considered by some critics to be the best science fiction book ever written.[84]The novel has been translated into dozens of languages, and has sold almost 20 million copies.[85]Dunehas been regularly cited as one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.[86][3]\n\nArthur C. ClarkedescribedDuneas \"unique\" and wrote, \"I know nothing comparable to it exceptThe Lord of the Rings.\"[87]Robert A. Heinleindescribed the novel as \"powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.\"[87][88]It was described as \"one of the monuments of modern science fiction\" by theChicago Tribune,[87]andP. Schuyler MillercalledDune\"one of the landmarks of modern science fiction ... an amazing feat of creation.\"[88]The Washington Postdescribed it as \"a portrayal of an alien society more complete and deeply detailed than any other author in the field has managed ... a story absorbing equally for its action and philosophical vistas ... An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.\"[87][88]Algis BudryspraisedDunefor the vividness of its imagined setting, saying \"The time lives. It breathes, it speaks, and Herbert has smelt it in his nostrils\". He found that the novel, however, \"turns flat and tails off at the end. ... [T]ruly effective villains simply simper and melt; fierce men and cunning statesmen and seeresses all bend before this new Messiah\". Budrys faulted in particular Herbert's decision to kill Paul's infant son offstage, with no apparent emotional impact, saying \"you cannot be so busy saving a world that you cannot hear an infant shriek\".[89]After criticizing unrealistic science fiction,Carl Saganin 1978 listedDuneas among stories \"that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical\".[90]\n\nThe Louisville Timeswrote, \"Herbert's creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics, and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.\"[88]Writing forThe New Yorker, Jon Michaud praised Herbert's \"clever authorial decision\" to exclude robots and computers (\"two staples of the genre\") from his fictional universe, but suggested that this may be one explanation whyDunelacks \"true fandom among science-fiction fans\" to the extent that it \"has not penetrated popular culture in the way thatThe Lord of the RingsandStar Warshave\".[14]Tamara I. Hladik wrote that the story \"crafts a universe where lesser novels promulgate excuses for sequels. All its rich elements are in balance and plausible—not the patchwork confederacy of made-up languages, contrived customs, and meaningless histories that are the hallmark of so many other, lesser novels.\"[91]\n\nOn November 5, 2019, theBBC NewslistedDuneon its list of the100 most influential novels.[92]\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkienrefused to reviewDune, on the grounds that he disliked it \"with some intensity\" and thus felt it would be unfair to Herbert, another working author, if he gave an honest review of the book.[93]\n\nThefirst editionofDuneis one of the most valuable in science fictionbook collecting. Copies have been sold for more than $20,000 at auction.[94]\n\nCalifornia State University, Fullerton's Pollak Library has several of Herbert's draft manuscripts ofDuneand other works, with the author's notes, in their Frank Herbert Archives.[95]\n\nAfterDuneproved to be a critical and financial success for Herbert, he was able to devote himself full time to writing additional novels in the series. He had already drafted parts of the second and third while writingDune.[14]The series includedDune Messiah(1969),Children of Dune(1976),God Emperor of Dune(1981),Heretics of Dune(1984), andChapterhouse: Dune(1985), each sequentially continuing on the narrative fromDune. Herbert died on February 11, 1986.[96]\n\nHerbert's son,Brian Herbert, had found several thousand pages of notes left by his father that outlined ideas for other narratives related toDune. Brian Herbert enlisted authorKevin J. Andersonto help build outprequelnovels to the events ofDune. Brian Herbert's and Anderson'sDuneprequelsfirst started publication in 1999, and have led to additional stories that take place between those of Frank Herbert's books.[97]The notes for what would have beenDune 7also enabled them to publishHunters of Dune(2006) andSandworms of Dune(2007), sequels to Frank Herbert's final novelChapterhouse: Dune, which complete the chronological progression of his original series, and wrap up storylines that began inHeretics of Dune.\n\nDunehas been considered an \"unfilmable\" and \"uncontainable\" work to adapt from novel to film or other visual medium.[98]Described byWired, \"It has four appendices and a glossary of its own gibberish, and its action takes place on two planets, one of which is a desert overrun by worms the size of airport runways. Lots of important people die or try to kill each other, and they're all tethered to about eight entangled subplots.\"[99]There have been several attempts to achieve this difficult conversion with various degrees of success.[100]\n\nIn 1971, the production company Apjac International (APJ) (headed byArthur P. Jacobs) optioned therights to filmDune. As Jacobs was busy with other projects, such as the sequel toPlanet of the Apes,Dunewas delayed for another year. Jacobs' first choice for director wasDavid Lean, but he turned down the offer.Charles Jarrottwas also considered to direct. Work was also under way on a script while the hunt for a director continued. Initially, the first treatment had been handled byRobert Greenhut, the producer who had lobbied Jacobs to make the movie in the first place, but subsequentlyRospo Pallenbergwas approached to write the script, with shooting scheduled to begin in 1974. However, Jacobs died in 1973.[101]\n\nIn December 1974, a French consortium led by Jean-Paul Gibon purchased the film rights from APJ, withAlejandro Jodorowskyset to direct.[102]In 1975, Jodorowsky planned to film the story as a 3-hour feature, set to star his own sonBrontis Jodorowskyin the lead role of Paul Atreides,Salvador DalíasShaddam IV, Padishah Emperor,Amanda LearasPrincess Irulan,Orson WellesasBaron Vladimir Harkonnen,Gloria SwansonasReverend MotherGaius Helen Mohiam,David CarradineasDuke Leto Atreides,Geraldine ChaplinasLady Jessica,Alain DelonasDuncan Idaho,Hervé VillechaizeasGurney Halleck,Udo Kieras Piter De Vries, andMick JaggerasFeyd-Rautha. It was at first proposed to score the film with original music byKarlheinz Stockhausen,Henry Cow, andMagma; later on, the soundtrack was to be provided byPink Floyd.[103]Jodorowsky set up a pre-production unit in Paris consisting ofChris Foss, a British artist who designed covers for science fiction periodicals,Jean Giraud (Moebius), a French illustrator who created and also wrote and drew forMetal Hurlantmagazine, andH. R. Giger.[102]Moebius began designing creatures and characters for the film, while Foss was brought in to design the film's space ships and hardware.[102]Giger began designing the Harkonnen Castle based on Moebius'sstoryboards.Dan O'Bannonwas to head the special effects department.[102]\n\nDalí was cast as the Emperor.[102]Dalí later demanded to be paid $100,000 per hour; Jodorowsky agreed, but tailored Dalí's part to be filmed in one hour, drafting plans for other scenes of the emperor to use a mechanical mannequin as substitute for Dalí.[102]According to Giger, Dalí was \"later invited to leave the film because of his pro-Francostatements\".[104]Just as the storyboards, designs, and script were finished, the financial backing dried up. Frank Herbert traveled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2 million of the $9.5 million budget had already been spent in pre-production, and that Jodorowsky's script would result in a 14-hour movie (\"It was the size of a phone book\", Herbert later recalled). Jodorowsky took creative liberties with the source material, but Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an amicable relationship. Jodorowsky said in 1985 that he found theDunestory mythical and had intended to re-create it rather than adapt the novel; though he had an \"enthusiastic admiration\" for Herbert, Jodorowsky said he had done everything possible to distance the author and his input from the project.[102]Although Jodorowsky was embittered by the experience, he said theDuneproject changed his life, and some of the ideas were used in his and Moebius'sThe Incal.[105]O'Bannon entered a psychiatric hospital after the production failed, then worked on 13 scripts, the last of which becameAlien.[102]A 2013 documentary,Jodorowsky's Dune, was made about Jodorowsky's failed attempt at an adaptation.\n\nIn 1976,Dino De Laurentiisacquired the rights from Gibon's consortium. De Laurentiis commissioned Herbert to write a new screenplay in 1978; the script Herbert turned in was 175 pages long, the equivalent of nearly three hours of screen time. De Laurentiis then hired directorRidley Scottin 1979, withRudy Wurlitzerwriting the screenplay and H. R. Giger retained from the Jodorowsky production; Scott and Giger had also just worked together on the filmAlien, after O'Bannon recommended the artist.[106][107]Scott intended to split the novel into two movies. He worked on three drafts of the script, usingThe Battle of Algiersas a point of reference, before moving on to direct another science fiction film,Blade Runner(1982). As he recalls, the pre-production process was slow, and finishing the project would have been even more time-intensive:\n\nBut after seven months I dropped out ofDune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer had come up with a first-draft script which I felt was a decent distillation of Frank Herbert's. But I also realisedDunewas going to take a lot more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him theDunescript was his.\n\nA draft of the screenplay for the Scott version was discovered in 2024 in theWheaton Collegearchives.[108]\n\nIn 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire. De Laurentiis re-negotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to theDunesequels (written and unwritten). After seeingThe Elephant Man, De Laurentiis' daughterRaffaelladecided thatDavid Lynchshould direct the movie. Around that time Lynch received several other directing offers, includingReturn of the Jedi. He agreed to directDuneand write the screenplay even though he had not read the book, was not familiar with the story, or even been interested in science fiction.[109]Lynch worked on the script for six months withEric Bergrenand Christopher De Vore. The team yielded two drafts of the script before it split over creative differences. Lynch would subsequently work on five more drafts. Production of the work was troubled by problems at the Mexican studio and hampering the film's timeline.[110]Lynch ended up producing a nearly three-hour long film, but at demands fromUniversal Pictures, the film's distributor, he cut it back to about two hours, hastily filming additional scenes to make up for some of the cut footage.[111]\n\nThisfirst filmofDune, directed by Lynch, was released in 1984, nearly 20 years after the book's publication. Though Herbert said the book's depth and symbolism seemed to intimidate many filmmakers, he was pleased with the film, saying that \"They've got it. It begins asDunedoes. And I hear my dialogue all the way through. There are some interpretations and liberties, but you're gonna come out knowing you've seenDune.\"[112]Reviews of the film were negative, saying that it was incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book, and that fans would be disappointed by the way it strayed from the book's plot.[113][114][115][98][116]Upon release for television and other forms of home media, Universal opted to reintroduce much of the footage that Lynch had cut, creating an over-three-hour long version with extensive monologue exposition. Lynch was extremely displeased with this move, and demanded that Universal replace his name on these cuts with the pseudonym \"Alan Smithee\", and has generally distanced himself from the film since.[111]\n\nIn 2000,John Harrisonadapted the novel intoFrank Herbert's Dune, aminiseriesthat premiered on theSci-Fi Channel.[17]As of 2004, the miniseries was one of the three highest-rated programs broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel.[117]\n\nIn 2008,Paramount Picturesannounced that they would produce a new film based on the book, withPeter Bergattached to direct.[118]ProducerKevin Misher, who spent a year securing the rights from the Herbert estate, was to be joined by Richard Rubinstein and John Harrison (of both Sci-Fi Channel miniseries) as well as Sarah Aubrey and Mike Messina.[118]The producers stated that they were going for a \"faithful adaptation\" of the novel and considered \"its theme of finite ecological resources particularly timely\".[118]Science fiction authorKevin J. Andersonand Frank Herbert's sonBrian Herbert, who had together written multipleDunesequelsandprequelssince 1999, were attached to the project as technical advisors.[119]In October 2009, Berg dropped out of the project, later saying that it \"for a variety of reasons wasn't the right thing\" for him.[120]Subsequently, with a script draft by Joshua Zetumer, Paramount reportedly sought a new director who could do the film for under $175 million.[121]In 2010,Pierre Morelwas signed on to direct, with screenwriter Chase Palmer incorporating Morel's vision of the project into Zetumer's original draft.[122][123]By November 2010, Morel left the project.[124]Paramount finally dropped plans for a remake in March 2011.[125]\n\nIn November 2016,Legendary Entertainmentacquired the film and TV rights forDune.[126][127]Varietyreported in December 2016 thatDenis Villeneuvewas in negotiations to direct the project,[128]which was confirmed in February 2017.[129]In April 2017, Legendary announced thatEric Rothwould write the screenplay.[130]Villeneuve explained in March 2018 that his adaptation will be split into two films, with the first installment scheduled to begin production in 2019.[131]Casting includesTimothée Chalametas Paul Atreides,[132]Dave Bautistaas Rabban,Stellan Skarsgårdas Baron Harkonnen,[133]Rebecca Fergusonas Lady Jessica,[134]Charlotte Ramplingas Reverend Mother Mohiam,[135]Oscar Isaacas Duke Leto Atreides,[136]Zendayaas Chani,[137]Javier Bardemas Stilgar,[138]Josh Brolinas Gurney Halleck,[139]Jason Momoaas Duncan Idaho,[140]David Dastmalchianas Piter De Vries,[141]Chang Chenas Dr. Yueh,[142]andStephen HendersonasThufir Hawat.[143]Warner Bros.

It received critical acclaim especially for its visual effects and has grossed over $711 million worldwide, making it thefourth-highest-grossing film of 2024.\n\nIn 1993,Recorded BooksInc. released a 20-discaudiobooknarrated byGeorge Guidall. In 2007,Audio Renaissancereleased an audio book narrated bySimon Vancewith some parts performed byScott Brick,Orlagh Cassidy,Euan Morton, and other performers.\n\nDunehas been widely influential, inspiring numerous novels, music, films, television, games, and comic books.[152]It is considered one of the greatest and most influential science fiction novels of all time, with numerous modern science fiction works such asStar Warsowing their existence toDune.[153]Dunehas also been referenced in numerous other works ofpopular culture, includingStar Trek,Chronicles of Riddick,The Kingkiller ChronicleandFuturama.[154]Dunewas cited as a source of inspiration forHayao Miyazaki'sanimefilmNausicaä of the Valley of the Wind(1984) for its post-apocalyptic world.[155][156][157][158][159]\n\nDunewas parodied in 1984'sNational Lampoon's DoonbyEllis Weiner, which William F. Touponce called \"something of a tribute to Herbert's success on college campuses\", noting that \"the only other book to have been so honored isTolkien'sThe Lord of the Rings,\" whichwas parodiedbyThe Harvard Lampoonin 1969.[160]\n\nThere have been a number ofgames based on the book, starting with thestrategy–adventure gameDune(1992). The most important game adaptation isDune II(1992), which established the conventions of modernreal-time strategygames and is considered to be among the most influentialvideo gamesof all time.[184]\n\nThe online gameLost SoulsincludesDune-derived elements, including sandworms and melange—addiction to which can produce psychic talents.[185]The 2016 gameEnter the Gungeonfeatures the spice melange as a random item which gives the player progressively stronger abilities and penalties with repeated uses, mirroring the long-term effects melange has on users.[186]\n\nRick PriestleycitesDuneas a major influence on his 1987wargame,Warhammer 40,000.[187]\n\nIn 2023,FuncomannouncedDune: Awakening, an upcomingmassively multiplayer online gameset in the universe ofDune.[188][189][190]\n\nTheApollo 15astronauts named asmall crateron Earth'sMoonafter the novel during the 1971 mission,[191]and the name was formally adopted by theInternational Astronomical Unionin 1973.[192]Since 2009, the names of planets from theDunenovels have been adopted for the real-world nomenclature of plains and other features onSaturn's moonTitan, likeArrakis Planitia.[193][194][195]",
