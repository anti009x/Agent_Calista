As expounded across several interwoven MCU multimedia titles, the six Infinity Stones are reputed to embody and control essential aspects of existence—Space, Mind, Reality, Power, Time, and Soul—thereby making them critical artifacts in the MCU and, together, theMacGuffinof the dedicatedInfinity Saga.\n\nThe Stones, with the exception of the Soul Stone, made their debuts in films leading up toAvengers: Infinity War(2018). The Space Stone, the first Stone to appear, was featured in apost-credit sceneforThor(2011), housed within the Tesseract. The Stone / Tesseract established its significance in the MCU through the antecedent films,Captain America: The First Avenger(2011) andThe Avengers(2012). InThe First Avenger, theRed Skullused the power of the Stone to powerHydra's weaponry duringWorld War II. InThe Avengers,Lokiwas sent to Earth byThanosto get the Stone fromS.H.I.E.L.D.The Space Stone did not make another appearance untilPhase Three, when it made a minor appearance inThor: Ragnarok(2017) and played a major role inCaptain Marvel(2019) when it was revealed that the Stone gaveCarol Danversher powers. The Mind Stone first showed up inThe Avengers, housed in asceptergiven to Loki in his efforts to get the Space Stone from Earth. The Stone returned within the scepter inAvengers: Age of Ultron(2015) where it was being used on human test subjects. The Mind Stone was eventually used to giveVisionlife.\n\nThor: The Dark World(2013) introduced the Reality Stone in its liquid form known as the Aether. It temporarily infectedJane Fosterbefore it was given toThe Collectorto keep it separate from the Space Stone. The Power and Time Stones made their debuts inGuardians of the Galaxy(2014) andDoctor Strange(2016) respectively.Ronan the Accuserseeks out the Power Stone for Thanos, but he is defeated by theGuardians of the Galaxy, who entrust the Stone with theNova Corps.Stephen Strangefinds the Eye of Agamotto, which houses the Time Stone, and uses it to save Earth from the demon,Dormammu. The Soul Stone was the last Stone to make an appearance, first showing up inInfinity Warwhen Thanos collects the Stone onVormirafter sacrificingGamora.\n\nThanos sets out to collect all six Stones to use them to wipe out half of all life in the universe, believing that his plan will save it from extinction. In 2018, Thanos accomplishes his goal and snaps his fingers while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet containing the Stones, causingthe Blip. Thanos eventually uses the Stones again to destroy them and five years later,  the survivingAvengersform a plan to go back in time to collect the Stones from other time periods to undo Thanos' snap. After defeating Thanos and undoing his actions from 2018,Steve Rogers / Captain Americareturns the Stones to the exact moments in time that the Avengers collected them from.\n\nDespite being destroyed, the Stones make appearances in theMultiverse Saga, including inDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness(2022) inan alternate universewhere Thanos was defeated on his home planet ofTitanby theIlluminatibefore he can collect all of the Stones. They also make appearances in several of the MCU television series onDisney+, between flashbacks inWandaVision(2021) and alternate universes in the first season ofLoki(2021) and the animated seriesWhat If...?(2021–24). Scientific studies relating to the Stones have been conducted, mostly since the release ofInfinity War, including one focusing on the control of matter.\n\nThe stories of the Stones in the MCU take place in theEarth-616universe.[a]The fictional information below includes events that happened with the Stones from more than one Earth-616 timeline, as well as events that happened with them in multiple otheruniverses.\n\nIn 2014, theCollectorexplains that the Infinity Stones are the remnants of sixsingularitiesthat existed before theBig Bang, which were compressed into Stones by cosmic entities after the universe began and which were dispersed throughout the cosmos.[3][4]Four years later, it is further explained byWongandStephen Strangethat each Infinity Stone embodies and controls an essential aspect of existence.[5]\n\nIn 1942, theRed Skullsteals the Tesseract, which contains the Space Stone, from a church and uses it to powerHydra's weaponry duringWorld War II. DuringSteve Rogers's final fight against Red Skull,[6]the Tesseract transports the latter to the planetVormir.[5]Afterwards, the Tesseract falls into the Arctic Ocean, where it is later recovered byHoward Starkand taken to a secret base.[6]\n\nDr.Wendy Lawsonunsuccessfully tries to use the Tesseract in 1989 to unlock light-speed travel to help theSkrullsfind a new home. However, her experiments result inCarol Danversbeing granted superhuman strength, flight, and the ability to generate energy blasts. Danvers eventually recovers the Tesseract and hands the object over toS.H.I.E.L.D., but it is temporarily swallowed by aFlerkennamedGoose, who later vomits it out onNick Fury's desk.[7]\n\nIn 2012, Fury shows the Tesseract to Dr.Erik Selvig, when the Tesseract suddenly opens a portal allowing forLokito come through.[8][9]Loki steals the Tesseract and later opens awormhole, using it to transport theChitauriarmy to New York City in an attempt to conquer Earth. After theAvengersrepel the invasion, Thor returns the Tesseract toAsgardfor safekeeping in Odin's vault, and it is used to repair theBifrost.[9][10]Years later, the Asgardian prophecy of its destruction by the fire demonSurturcomes true. Loki takes the Tesseract from the vault before escaping.[11][12]\n\nThe Stone is originally housed in asceptergiven to Loki byThanosandthe Otherto help locate the Tesseract and conquer Earth with its ability to control people's minds and project energy blasts.[9][13]After Loki's defeat, it falls into the hands of Hydra leader BaronWolfgang von Strucker, who uses it to experiment on people, including siblingsPietroandWanda Maximoff, who are the only surviving subjects of Strucker's experiments.[14][15]Von Strucker's experiments cause Pietro to gain superhuman abilities and amplify Wanda's powers.[15][16]Strucker's base is attacked by the Avengers, who take back the scepter. The Avengers discover that it contains the Mind Stone, which itself contains an artificial intelligence that grants sentience to the computer program Ultron, who steals the scepter and removes the Stone to create a newly upgraded body. The Avengers steal the Mind Stone–infused body from Ultron and upload the A.I.J.A.R.V.I.S.into it, giving birth to the androidVision.[10][13][15]\n\nEons ago,Malekithattempts to use the Reality Stone, appearing in its fluid-like weapon state called the Aether, to destroy theNine Realms. His plan was to return the universe to its pre-Big Bang state, only to be thwarted byBor, who had it hidden. In 2013,Jane Fosterbecomes infected by the Aether after coming across its resting place, though Malekith later draws it out of her. After Malekith is defeated byThor,SifandVolstagg, they seal the Aether in a lantern-like container and entrust it to the Collector to keep it separate from the Tesseract, as the three of them consider it unwise to have multiple Infinity Stones close to each other.[10][17][18][19]The Aether, once bonded to a host, can turn anything into dark matter as well as suck the life force out of humans and other mortals. The Aether can also disrupt the laws of physics and repel threats if it senses any.[1][17]\n\nHoused in the Orb hidden on the planetMorag, the Power Stone is capable of increasing the user's strength and destroying entire civilizations with a single blast. However, the Stone is too much for most mortal beings to physically handle because its power will destroy them on contact.[20][21]In 2014,Ronan the Accuserseeks the Orb for Thanos, butPeter Quillfinds and steals the Orb from Morag's resting spot beforeKorathcan. Ronan eventually steals it from the Guardians. After learning about the Power Stone, however, Ronan betrays Thanos and tries to use its destructive power to destroy the planetXandar. During the battle to protect Xandar, by sharing the burden of the Power Stone's energy, the Guardians are able to use it to kill Ronan. It is later revealed that Peter Quill's half-Celestial physiology allowed him to withstand the Stone's power on his own for a brief time before the other Guardians joined him. They seal the Power Stone in a new Orb and entrust it to theNova Corpsfor safekeeping.[3][10]\n\nIn 2016, Dr.Stephen Strangefinds the Eye of Agamotto, which houses the Time Stone, and learns how to use it to save the Earth fromDormammuby trapping him in atime loopuntil the demon abandons his plans for Earth. Strange returns the Eye of Agamotto to the Masters of the Mystic Arts' secret compoundKamar-Tajin Kathmandu, Nepal, but soon begins wearing it again.[11][22][23]\n\nAn object that has the ability to manipulate the soul and essence of a person,[2]control life and death, and contains a pocket dimension called theSoul World.[24]At some time in the past, Thanos tasksGamorato find the Soul Stone, as there is little record of its existence compared to the other Infinity Stones. Gamora finds a map leading to where it was hidden: in a shrine on the planet Vormir, but chooses to destroy the map and not tell Thanos, only telling Nebula of it and swearing her to secrecy, unaware that Thanos wasn't fooled by their lies.[5]\n\nThanos begins his quest to collect all six Stones by decimating Xandar to obtain the Power Stone. He then tracks down the Space Stone and intercepts the Asgardian ship on its way to Earth after the destruction of Asgard.[11][25]Thanos kills half of the occupants and threatens to kill Thor as well, but Loki gives up the Tesseract to save his brother's life. Thanos proceeds to crush the Tesseract to acquire the Space Stone. He tellshis childrento acquire the two Stones on Earth. He then uses the Power Stone to destroy the ship as he teleports his children and himself away with the Space Stone.[5]\n\nThanos' four children split up, with two looking to collect the Time Stone from Strange and the other two going after Vision for the Mind Stone. In New York,Ebony MawandCull Obsidianattempt to steal the Time Stone from Strange, but are foiled by Stark, Parker, and Wong. Strange is teleported up to Maw's ship with Stark and Parker sneaking on board. In Edinburgh, Vision is injured byProxima MidnightandCorvus Glaivein their attempts to get the Stone from his head. After the pair are defeated, Vision is taken to Wakanda to have the Stone removed byShuri, in the hope that Vision would be able to live without it.[5]\n\nWhile his children are on Earth, Thanos acquires the Aether from the Collector onKnowhereand turns it back into the Reality Stone, allowing for him to repel theGuardians of the Galaxy's attacks by turningDraxto rocks,Mantisinto ribbon strips, and causing Peter Quill's gun to shoot bubbles. Thanos then teleportsGamoraand himself back to his ship, where he is keeping a capturedNebula. He uses the Power Stone to torture her in front of Gamora, forcing Gamora to agree to take him to Vormir to find the Soul Stone. On Vormir, they encounter the Stone keeper, Red Skull. Thanos reluctantly sacrifices Gamora to fulfill the requirements to obtain the Soul Stone once the Red Skull explains to them that the Stone requires the sacrifice of a loved one to earn it.[26][27]\n\nMaw gets sucked out of an airlock and his ship takes Stark, Strange, and Parker toTitan, Thanos' home planet, where they run into Quill, Drax, and Mantis. Before Thanos arrives, Strange uses the Time Stone to look into future timelines and viewing millions of possible outcomes of their conflict, learning of only one future in which they win. Thanos arrives expecting Maw, and fights the Avengers and Guardians using the Stones. He defeats them all, leading Strange to surrender the Time Stone to prevent Thanos from killing Stark to ensure the winning future comes to pass.[5]\n\nThanos' remaining children arrive in Wakanda where Shuri is unable to complete the removal of the Mind Stone from Vision's head before she is attacked by Glaive. Thanos arrives looking to get the Stone himself, using some of the Stones against the Avengers and Wakandans trying to fight him off. As a result of the Stone still being in Vision's head, Wanda is forced to destroy Vision and the Stone to try to prevent Thanos from getting it, only for Thanos to use the Time Stone to repair them both and collect the latter. Thanos uses all of the Stones to initiatethe Blip, where he is briefly transported into the Soul World and encounters a vision of a young Gamora.[28]He then teleports away with the Space Stone to theGarden. Thanos uses the Stones to destroy them to prevent further use in the future.[5][29][30]\n\nAfterScott Langis freed from theQuantum Realmfive years after the Blip,[31]he goes to the Avengers Compound and brings up the idea of atime heistusing the Quantum Realm to collect each Stone from different points in time as changing the past does not change the future and instead creates alternate timelines. The surviving Avengers split up into teams to each focus on one Stone.[29]\n\nRogers, Stark, Lang, and Banner travel to an alternate 2012, where the Space, Mind, and Time Stones are all located. Stark and Lang attempt to steal the alternate 2012 Tesseract, but the alternate 2012 Hulk accidentally knocks Stark down and the 2012 Tesseract is taken by the alternate 2012 Loki, who uses it to open a wormhole and escape. Rogers retrieves the scepter containing the 2012 Mind Stone, using it to render his alternate 2012 self unconscious after he mistook him for a disguised Loki. Banner convinces theAncient Oneto relinquish that timeline's Time Stone, promising to return it after they are done using it to ensure that the alternate timelines will survive. After failing to retrieve the 2012 Space Stone, Stark and Rogers travel to an alternate 1970 and take the alternate 1970 Tesseract fromCamp Lehigh, New Jerseyand use a stolen briefcase to smuggle it out.[29]\n\nThor andRockettravel back to Asgard in an alternate 2013 to extract the alternate 2013 Aether from the alternate 2013 Jane Foster.James RhodesandNebulatravel back to Morag in an alternate 2014, subduing the alternate 2014 Peter Quill before taking the 2014 Power Stone in its Orb. Romanoff andClint Bartontravel to Vormir in an alternate 2014, where each attempts to sacrifice themselves to allow the other to return with the Stone, ultimately ending with Romanoff sacrificing herself.[29]\n\nAll of the Stones are brought back to the present day and removed from their containers while the 2013 Aether is turned into its solid state. Stark creates aNano Gauntletto house the Stones, which Banner uses to undo the Blip. An alternate 2014 Thanos, having been alerted by their actions due to Nebula's cybernetic systems connecting with her alternate 2014 self, brings his army to the future, destroying the compound and intending to use the Stones to destroy and recreate the universe out of revenge for the Blip being undone, but is ultimately defeated when Stark sacrifices himself to disintegrate Thanos and his army with the Stones in the Nano Gauntlet. After Stark's funeral, Rogers returns all of the past Stones to the points in time that they were collected from, although without the Tesseract, scepter, Orb, and with the Reality Stone still in its solid form.[29]\n\nThree weeks after Thanos' snap is undone, a still grieving Wanda Maximoff uses her connection with the Mind Stone to reanimate a fake Vision. Later on,Agatha Harknessshows Maximoff various points in her past, including the moment of Hydra's experimentation with the Stone on her. Maximoff learns that the exposure to the Stone tapped into and amplifyed her innate magic, as well as giving her a prophetic vision of her as the Scarlet Witch.[16][32]\n\nOther versions of the Stones are depicted in the alternate realities of the MCU multiverse.\n\nAn alternate 2012 Loki, who escaped during the Avengers' attempt to collect all the Infinity Stones to undo Thanos' actions,[29]has the alternate 2012 Tesseract confiscated by theTime Variance Authority(TVA). Later, Loki tries to retrieve the Tesseract only to find that it is powerless in the TVA, along with all the other Stones, in which the TVA has captured dozens of each from other timelines.[33][34]The Stones are used as paperweights in the TVA, as such thefounderof the TVA and his severalKang the Conquerorvariantsare more powerful than the Stones.[35]\n\nIn analternate version of World War II, Howard Stark uses the confiscated Tesseract as the power source for theHydra Stomper.[36]Inanother universe,T'Challa, rather than Peter Quill, finds the Power Stone on Morag.[37]Inan alternate version of 2016, Stephen Strange attempts to use the Time Stone to prevent the death ofChristine Palmer, only to find her death is an absolute point in his universe, meaning no matter what he does, she's destined to die, despite his countless attempts to avert the scenario. It becomes the only Stone left in existence in his universe due to his subsequent actions.[38]\n\nAsone universe suffers from a quantum zombie outbreak, Vision discovers that his Mind Stone can be used to cure the infected. However, it is unable to cure the infected Maximoff, due to her powers coming from the Stone, prompting Vision to initially try and feed other survivors to Maximoff to keep her calm until he can properly cure her.[39]When other heroes find him, Vision accepts that his actions are wrong and he gives the Stone to the surviving heroes to take to Wakanda, sacrificing himself out of guilt. However, a zombified Thanos arrives in Wakanda, possessing the other five Infinity Stones in his Gauntlet.[40]\n\nIn another scenario, Thanos once again arrives on Earth with five Stones, only to discover thatthe Avengers lost to Ultron, who is in possession of Vision's vibranium body and the Mind Stone. Ultron kills Thanos and takes the Stones for himself, using them to conquer and destroy his universe. When this task is complete, Ultron attains a higher level of consciousness and uses the Stones to travel into other dimensions and duelthe Watcher.[41]To stop Infinity Ultron expanding into other universes, the Watcher assembles theGuardians of the Multiverse, a team of heroes from various alternate realities, including Strange Supreme, and gifts them a weapon to destroy the Stones called the Infinity Crusher. When the Crusher fails due to it being designed to only work for the Stones in its respective universe, the heroes kill Ultron by uploadingArnim Zola's analog consciousness into his body. The Stones are nearly taken byKillmonger, but he is stopped by Zola, who tries to take the Stones for himself. Strange Supreme and the Watcher imprison them along with the Stones in a pocket dimension, frozen outside of time so that neither they nor the Stones from Ultron's universe can be a threat anymore.[42]\n\nInKahhori's universe, the Tesseract crashes into a lake in pre-colonial America after survivingRagnorokand breaks, releasing unmitigated Space Stone energy into the lake's waters. As a result, a portal opens to another dimension called the Sky World, granting the inhabitants of that world incredible powers.[43]After getting transported into a dying universe in the year 1602, Captain Carter, with the help of Tony Stark, discovers a device powered by the Time Stone that had been caused when Steve Rogers, while fighting Thanos during the Battle of Wakanda, accidentally hit the Time Stone with one of his shields. Using Stark's device and the Time Stone, Carter and Rogers are able to set things right, returning Rogers to his own time and ending the temporal anomaly that was tearing apart the world.[44]Among Doctor Strange Supreme's prisoners that are released by Captain Carter is a Thanos with a completed Infinity Gauntlet. However, having been freed by Carter, Killmonger (who won the battle against Zola) disintegrates Thanos with his own set of Infinity Stones. Kahhori is able to use her Tesseract-granted powers to separate Killmonger from his Infinity Armor and teleport him away, allowing Carter to take the Infinity Stones for herself. Carter is able to wield the Infinity Stones against Strange alongside Hela's crown and the weapons of some of the freed prisoners. By punching Strange with the Infinity Stones, Carter manages to bring him back to his senses temporarily.[45]\n\nIn the last two episodes of season three, another set of Infinity Stones is seen wielded by an alternate version of Infinity Ultron, who had succeeded in destroying all life in his universe, but was left with no purpose. Carter requests for his help to rescue the Watcher before she is captured by the Eminence. Kahhori, Byrdie, and Storm later do the same, and Infinity Ultron agrees to help rescue Carter and the Watcher. During the battle against the Eminence, Incarnate, and Executioner, he sacrifices himself to allow the others to escape.\n\nOnEarth-838, theIlluminatifought against Thanos on Titan who was in possession of five Infinity Stones. They killed him, leaving the gauntlet and the Stones in their responsibility.[46]\n\nTwo variants of the Reality and Time Stones are shown to be embedded in a sling ring Cassandra Nova had taken from an unidentified variant of Stephen Strange. This allows her to open a portal from the Void to Earth-10005 and allow Deadpool and Wolverine to return to it. She later uses it to send the Deadpool Corps to that timeline to keep them from reaching her.\n\nThe Infinity Gauntlet is a left handed metalGauntletused to house the six Stones. A right-handed Gauntlet appears inThor(2011), where it's stored inOdin's vault,[10]though this one was later revealed to be a fake byHelainThor: Ragnarok.[47]The mid-credits scene ofAvengers: Age of Ultron(2015) revealed Thanos had acquired a left-handed Infinity Gauntlet.[15][48]InInfinity War, it is revealedThanosinvadedNidavellirand forcedEitrito create the Infinity Gauntlet by threatening to kill his people, though he did so anyway once it was completed, as well as removing Eitri's hands to prevent his making of anything else.[49]After obtaining all six Infinity Stones, Thanos snaps his fingers in the Gauntlet and erases half of all life in the universe.\n\nInEndgame, the Gauntlet is revealed to be burnt and permanently bound to Thanos' swollen arm. After Thor kills Thanos, the charred damaged Gauntlet is left abandoned on the Garden planet. Five years later, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, and Rocket usenanotechnologyto create a right-handed Nano Gauntlet to use the alternate universe versions of the Infinity Stones. Banner in his \"Smart Hulk\" form, due to being the most immune to the gamma radiation that the Infinity Stones' combined powers emit, uses the Nano Gauntlet to reverse the Blip. However, the strain of channeling the combined powers still causes him considerable pain and leaves him with a crippled right arm. During the battle at the Avengers Compound, an alternate variant of Thanos from 2014 attempts to use the Nano Gauntlet. Although he successfully acquires it, Stark magnetically removes the Stones from the Nano Gauntlet and, wielding a makeshift Gauntlet formed within his armor, uses them to erase Thanos, his army, and the Nano Gauntlet. \nThe original Gauntlet appears in flashback sequences fromInfinity WarinWandaVision(2021).\n\nAlternate versions of the Infinity Gauntlet made brief appearances inWhat If...?, first in the fifth episode, when a zombified Thanos shows up inWakanda,[40]: 27:51–27:59and the eighth episode when Thanos arrives on Earth but is swiftly killed byUltron.[41]: 6:20–6:30The Gauntlet returns in a small capacity during thesecond seasonofWhat If...?, appearing in the last two episodes. In theseason's penultimate episode, Steve Rogers unwillingly strikes the Time Stone while fighting Thanos and in thefinal episodewhere the Gauntlet is used by another version of Thanos, who is then killed by Killmonger.[44][45]A Gauntlet appears in a flashback sequence inDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness(2022) after Thanos is killed onTitanby theIlluminati.[50][51]\n\nThe Infinity Stones played a big role in theMarvel Cinematic Universe'sInfinity Saga, but they were not the original story plan. Despite the Space Stone being introduced inThor, and the Mind Stone and Thanos debuting inThe Avengers, there were no official plans until at least 2012 to make the Stones theMacGuffinsof the Saga.James Gunnrevealed that it wasn't until after he completed his first draft forGuardians of the Galaxy(2014) thatMarvel Studiosdecided to put a bigger focus on the Stones moving forward.[53]Gunn revealed during the press tour forGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3(2023) that he wrote the scene introducing the Stones' backstory in an hour and a half starting with thePower Stonebeing in possession of the Collector at the time.[52]The Power Stone's color had to be changed from red like it is in the comics, to purple in the middle of development onGuardians of the Galaxybecause Marvel decided that the Aether was going to be the Reality Stone.[53][54]\n\nIn the comics, Thanos is motivated to retrieve and use theInfinity Gemsto impressLady Deathas she believed that the universe was overpopulated and headed for mass extinction. In the films, there is no mention of Lady Death, and Thanos wishes to reduce the population to avoid a repeat of his experience on Titan.[55]Thanos retrieved each gem from a being who held it at the time. TheIn-Betweenerhad the Soul Gem, theChampion of the Universehad the Power Gem, theGardenerhad the Time Gem, theCollectorhad the Reality Gem, theRunnerhad the Space Gem, and theGrandmasterhad the Mind Gem. Furthermore, nobody else was even aware of Thanos, therefore no one attempted to stop him.[56]\n\nIn the comics, the gems had other rules, and simply being in possession of one wasn't good enough. Each gem was powered by mastering a primordial force characterized by one of the other gems. For example, mastering the Power Gem was dependent on the user's mastery of the mind, while mastery of the soul correlated with the power of the Mind Gem.[57]The colors of the stones were originally different in the comics. They were purple for Space, yellow for Reality, red for Power, blue for Mind, orange for Time, and green for Soul.[58]The stone colors were updated in theMarvel Legacyseries to match the film versions.[59]In the MCU, the Time Stone is housed in the Eye of Agamotto and the Space Stone is housed in the Tesseract. However, the Marvel Comics versions of these two stones have no connections to these relics.[60][61]\n\nThe existence of the Infinity Stones in the MCU has been described as the \"one driving force that unifies all the robot-alien-hero fighting\" byThe Verge.[58]The use of the Infinity Stones as a plot device led to fan speculation as to the location of as-yet undiscovered Stones, and the possible appearance of additional Stones. One theory popular with fans was that words describing the nature or location of the Stones spelled out the name \"THANOS\", and that the as-yet undiscovered Soul Stone was somehow associated with the characterHeimdall.[58]Another theory proposed prior to the release ofEndgamewas that it would involve a seventh Infinity Stone corresponding to an additional Infinity Gem from the comics, the Ego Stone.[62]\n\nCharles Pulliam-Moore ofGizmodothought that the Soul Stone was the least interesting Stone because unlike the others, it was never given a chance to show why it can be formidable on its own like the other Stones had a chance to do in previous MCU films. However, during theInfinity Wardirectors commentary, they confirmed that the Stone has some of the elements of its comic counterpart including \"conjuring the spiritual representations of the dead on another plane of existence\".[63]\n\nAtSan Diego Comic-Conin 2022, Marvel and East Continental Gems announced the Infinity Collection of Gemstones, a set of six Gem stones representing each Stone and displayed in an Infinity Gauntlet created by Gentle Giant Ltd. All six gems combined are over 150caratsand valued atUSD$25 million. Each Stone is represented by different gems: The Time Stone is a Colombianemeraldnearing 23 carats, the Space Stone is asapphirefrom Madagascar, with over 30 carats, the Reality Stone is a naturalrubyfrom Mozambique, Africa with over 15 carats, the Power Stone is a naturalamethystwith more than 35 carats, the Soul Stone isspessartite, exceeding 35 carats, and the Mind Stone is a cut yellowdiamond, that's close to 35 carats.[64]AfterInfinity Warreleased in theaters,Hot Toysunveiled a 1:1 scale Infinity Gauntlet with the Stones capable of lighting up with the use of embedded LED lights.[65]Legoalso released their own Infinity Gauntlet set in 2021 to celebrate the Infinity Saga.[66]\n\nThe Snap and the Blip entered the popular lexicon as a metaphor for the idea of unilaterally bringing into being one's desired goals through one's force of will alone. In a November 30, 2023, article forSFGate, columnist Drew Magary reacted to the conduct of billionaire entrepreneur andTwitterownerElon Musk, who contended that large advertisers who left Twitter after Musk had praised a tweet espousing theGreat Replacementtheory as \"the actual truth\" would be to blame if their exodus bankrupted that company, rather than Musk himself. WhenNew York Timescontributor Andrew Ross Sorkin stated that those advertisers would likely dispute this, Musk replied, \"Tell it to Earth.\" Taking a critical view of this position, Magary, wrote:[67]\n\n\"But Musk, who told Sorkin that he believed data to be more valuable than gold, remains committed to the idea that owning X means owning the chief information exchange for all of this planet's 8 billion citizens. He thinks he canThanos Snapwars and recessions into being merely by posting a recycled Pepe the Frog meme from 2016 on there. There is no reasoning with someone who is so megalomaniacal and so, SO stupid.\"[67]\n\nA 2018 article inExtreme Mechanics Lettersproposed that Thanos would have needed \"a minimum grip strength of over 40,000 tons, which is approximately 750,000 times that of a typical man\", to break the Tesseract depicted in the film, presuming that the object was an \"all-carbon nano-tesseract or hypercube projected into 3D space\".[68]A study published in 2020 focused on the ability to control matter as Thanos does while using the Stones. The researchers found that on amacroscopic level, someone would need a large amount of energy to control matter, similarly to the Stones. However,microscopiclyscientists can mimic Thanos' control of matter at thecolloidallevel. The researchers were able to make billions of colloidal particles with changeable responsiveness, patchiness, shapes, and sizes by manipulating them using triggers, including temperature, pH, and light.[69]",

Lesser beings would face dire consequences:Johann Schmidtwas cursed toVormirto guard theSoul Stoneafter touching an activeTesseract,Jane Fosterbecame ill after being exposed to theAether,Carinaexploded when she touched thePower Stone; however, these effects can be reduced if a group is sharing the power among themselves. It is also possible to place an Infinity Stone (or multiple) inside a container to allow the user to wield the Stone's power without suffering the normal repercussions. Examples include theSpace Stoneinside theTesseract, theMind Stoneinside theScepterand later inVision's forehead, thePower Stoneinside theOrband later theUniversal Weapon, theTime Stoneinside theEye of Agamotto, theReality Stoneas the Aether, and all of the Infinity Stones housed in theInfinity Gauntlet.\n\nWhen Thanos successfully collected all of them, he used their phenomenal powers toannihilatehalf of all living creatures in the universe. He later used the stones' power to reduce them to atoms, as to prevent his work from being undone and to keep himself or anyone else from abusing their power.\n\nFive years later, theAvengerstraveledback in timeto retrieve the stones from alternate timelines in order toresurrectthe victims of the Snap. After theBattle of Earth,Captain Americareturned the stones to their respective timelines.\n\nBefore the universe began, six singularities existed. TheBig Bangthen formed concentrated crystals out of them and sent the six stones hurtling throughout the universe. Each stone represented a different aspect of the universe (Space,Mind,Reality,Power,Time, andSoul).[4]\n\nEson the Searcheruses thePower Stoneto destroy an entire planet\n\nIn the distant past, thePower Stonewas used by theCelestialsas a means of placing judgment upon worlds and their populaces, wiping out entire civilizations by touching its power on the planet's surface. However, the stone was just as dangerous to its handler as it was to the societies against which it was used, as its insufficiently powerful handlers were destroyed by its power.[3]\n\nMalekithattempts to use theAether's power\n\nMalekith, the leader of theDark Elvessought to use theAetherto revert the universe to its prior state of eternal darkness, recementing his kind as the most dominant race in the universe. They were opposed by theAsgardiansunder the command of their king,Bor, who fought a protractedwar, eventually forcing the Dark Elves to retreat to their home world,Svartalfheim, where the finalbattlewas fought. In one last, desperate move, Malekith dropped the Dark Elf air fleet onto the battlefield, wiping out scores of Asgardians and Dark Elves, including his wife and son.\nMalekith took advantage of the ensuing chaos to escape on the remaining ship, with his lieutenantAlgrimand several dozen other warriors, entering a state of hibernation until the time of the nextConvergence, when Malekith intended to make another attempt at total conquest.\n\nBororders that the Aether be hidden away\n\nBelieving the Dark Elves completely defeated, Bor was left to decide what was to be done with the Aether. Knowing it was too powerful to be destroyed, his ordered it buried deep enough that it could never be found again. The order was carried out, and the Aether remained untouched for 5,000 years.[2]\n\nRed Skullcreates weapons with theTesseract\n\nDuringWorld War II,Johann Schmidtbecame fascinated by tales of ancient mythical powers and decided to locate theTesseractto discover its true power. In1942, Schmidt invadedTønsbergand found the Tesseract in a box hidden behind a sculptured mural ofYggdrasil, the world tree. Schmidt took the Tesseract back toHYDRA Headquartersto be experimented on byArnim Zola. Schmidt and Zola were able to harness the Tesseract's power to create and fuel their weapons of war.\n\nTheTesseractteleportingRed SkulltoVormir\n\nInMarch 1945, Schmidt intended to use the Tesseract-poweredValkyrieand itsflying energy bombsto attack theUnited States of America. However, Schmidt wasconfrontedbyCaptain Americaand theHowling Commandoswho aimed to stop him. During the battle, Rogers damaged the machine that was using the Tesseract to power theValkyrie. Angered, Schmidt physically handled the Tesseract, burning his hand. As punishment for abusing the power of an Infinity Stone for selfish gain, the Tesseract opened a portal leading to the far-off planet ofVormirand banished Schmidt to remain there.[4]\n\nTheTesseractis found byHoward Stark\n\nWith Schmidt believed dead, the Tesseract fell while burning through the floors of theValkyrie, causing it to plunge into the sea below. Sometime later, it was recovered byHoward Stark, CEO ofStark Industriesand a member of theStrategic Scientific Reserve, who was attempting to locate his friend Captain America. Stark had the Tesseract locked away with the SSR where it was kept and studied for the next seventy years.[7]\n\nTheSpace Stoneused as an energy core\n\nUnderstanding that theKreebrought only misery to theSkrullsduring theKree-Skrull War, the Kree scientist,Mar-Vell, intended to help a group of Skrull refugees led byTalos, to find a new home away from Kree oppression. Mar-Vell impersonated as a human named Dr. Wendy Lawson and worked for theUnited States Air ForceonProject P.E.G.A.S.U.S.in order to harness the power of theTesseractto develop aLight-Speed Engine. The pilotsCarol DanversandMaria Rambeauwere unknowingly testing the engine in test flights. At the time the Tesseract was stored onMar-Vell's Laboratory, located inEarth's orbit.\n\nCarol Danversis exposed to theSpace Stone\n\nOne day, Mar-Vell and Danvers on a test flight of the Light-Speed Engine were attacked byStarforceand shot-down. The two crashed and Mar-Vell revealed herself to Danvers as a Kree and her motives with the engine and urged her to not let the Kree acquire it. Mar-Vell was shot and killed by Starforce commander,Yon-Rogg, who was then about to kill Danvers as well, but she shot the engine and destroyed it, creating an energy explosion. Danvers absorbed the Tesseract's energy during the explosion and gained superhuman abilities. Yon-Rogg then took her as Kree prisoner toHala, erasing her memories in the process and giving her a blood transfusion.\n\nTheTesseractbeing vomited up byGoose\n\nAfter six years, when Danvers returned to Earth, she joined forces withNick FuryfromS.H.I.E.L.D.and learned the truth about the Kree-Skrull War from Talos after she regained some of her memories. Wanting to assist Talos' people, Danvers and Fury flew to Mar-Vell's laboratory to retrieve the Tesseract. When they found it and the Skrulls, the Starforce arrived and tried to take the Tesseract. Fury fled to Earth with the Skrulls and the Tesseract, which had been swallowed by theFlerken,Goose. Following Danvers' victory over the Kree, she left Earth with the Skrulls, letting Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. keep the Tesseract, which Goose vomited up on Fury's desk.[8]∆\n\nTheTesseracttransportsLokitoEarth\n\nIn2012, after his defeat at the hands ofThor,Lokicame into contact with the alien race known as theChitauri, and their master,Thanos, who had already been seeking theTesseract. Loki promised to retrieve it fromEarthand give it to Thanos in exchange for his army. Through manipulation of the Tesseract's energy, Thanos teleported Loki to the Tesseract's location at theJoint Dark Energy Mission Facility.\n\nHawkeyeis controlled by theMind Stone\n\nThanos also provided Loki with aSceptercontaining theMind Stone. Once Loki arrived on Earth, he found a team ofS.H.I.E.L.D.agents who had been experimenting with the Tesseract's power. Loki used the power of the Scepter todefeatthem all, before puttingClint Barton,Erik Selvig, and several other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents under his complete control, ordering them to killNick Furyand steal the Tesseract for him. Selvig continued to experiment on the Tesseract in order to learn how to open a large sustainable portal.\n\nBruce Bannerunwittingly holds theScepter\n\nWhen Loki was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., the Scepter fell into their hands and was experimented on byTony StarkandBruce Banner. However, the Mind Stone's power proved more subtle and began to infect theAvengerspersonally, making them more doubtful and causing a large argument between them that only ended when Banner realized that he had been unwittingly made to pick up the Scepter. During theAttack on the Helicarrier, Loki regained the Scepter, which he used to murderPhil Coulsonbefore escaping.\n\nTheTesseractopens a portal between worlds\n\nSelvig used the Tesseract andStark Towerto create a portal aboveNew York Citywhich allowed Loki's army to pour through andattack, beginning theChitauri Invasion. With hordes ofChitauriandLeviathanscharging through the portal, only theAvengersstood in their way. Loki tried and failed to controlIron Manwith the Scepter. Eventually,Black Widowwas able to close the portal using the Scepter while Iron Man destroyed theChitauri Command Centerwith anAtomic Bombbefore Loki was captured by the team.\n\nTheTesseractis handed over toAsgard\n\nWhile Loki was taken back toAsgardwithThorto await punishment by their fatherOdin, theTesseractwas handed over to Thor to be kept away from theWorld Security Council. Thor and Loki used the cube to teleport themselves back to Asgard[1]before Thor handed it over toHeimdallwho used its power to rebuild theBifrost Bridge,[9]which had been destroyed during theDuel at the Rainbow Bridge,[10]finally allowing Thor and the other Asgardians to be transported across theNine Realmswith ease once again.[2]\n\nMalekithfinally regains theAether\n\nAs theConvergencebegan across theNine Realms,Jane Fosteraccidentally discovered and became infected with theAether, alerting theDark Elvesto its presence.MalekithwagedwaragainstAsgard, who were protecting Foster, to regain the Aether. Eventually Foster came toSvartalfheimwhere Malekith reclaimed the Aether and absorbed it.\n\nMalekithunleashes theAether's power\n\nMalekith took the Aether toEarthwhere he attempted to use its power to convert the entire universe into eternal darkness. Thor also returned to Earth where heconfrontedthe leader of the Dark Elves. Malekith used the Aether to battle Thor across worlds during the Convergence until eventually, they became separated and Malekith unleashed the Aether's power. Thor andErik Selvigwere able to destroy Malekith before he could complete his plans.\n\nTheAetheris given to theCollector\n\nThe Aether was soon regained byAsgardwho decided that it was too dangerous to keep two Infinity Stones so close together, so they kept theTesseractwhere it was and decided to relocate the Aether. Eventually,SifandVolstaggdecided to hand the Aether over toTaneleer Tivan, who vowed to keep it safe within theCollector's Museum. However, once the Asgardians left, Tivan revealed his intent to locate the other five stones for his collection.[2]\n\nBaronWolfgang von Struckerwith theScepter\n\nWhile theTesseractwas taken toAsgard, theScepterremained on Earth where it fell into the hands ofHYDRA's leaderWolfgang von Strucker. In HYDRA's hands, Strucker andListbegan experimenting with giving normal humans gifts via the Scepter's power, and, in the process, killing everyone except forPietroandWanda Maximoff, who were granted incredible powers to be used for HYDRA's benefit in theirwarwithS.H.I.E.L.D.[11]\n\nStar-Lorddiscovering theOrb\n\nTheOrbwas hidden away insideMorag's deepTemple Vaultwhere it was eventually located byYondu Udonta'sRavagers. Before Udonta could claim it, however,Star-Lordfound it and took it for himself, only to be almost immediately confronted byKorathwho had been ordered to find it byRonan the Accuser. During theirensuing confrontation, Star-Lord escaped with the Orb, despite being chased down by Korath's army ofSakaaransand becoming the target ofGamora, who had been sent byThanosand Ronan to reclaim the Orb. TheNova Corpscaptured Star-Lord for his crimes and also took the Orb.\n\nTheCollectorfinally opens theOrb\n\nStar-Lord and Gamora made a deal, along withRocket,GrootandDrax the Destroyerto join forces toescapetheKylnand sell the Orb to theCollector. The plan worked out and eventually, the group made it toKnowherewhere they were greeted byCarinaand the Collector, who told them the full story of the Infinity Stones. Just before the Collector could buy the Orb, Carina, who was tired of the torment her master put her through, touched the stone inside, causing a massive explosion that destroyed theCollector's Museumand forced them to escape.\n\nRonan the Accusertakes theOrb's power\n\nAs a result, the Orb was located byRonan the Accuser, whose forces ofSakaaransled byNebulamanaged tooverpowerGamoraand claim the Orb for themselves. Having learned that the Orb contained the Power Stone, however, Ronan chose not to hand it over toThanosas he had agreed. Instead, he took its power for himself, planning to use it to destroyXandarbefore attacking Thanos himself, while gaining the support of bothNebulaandKorathin his plans.\n\nTheGuardians of the Galaxyunleash the energy of thePower Stone\n\nAlthoughRonan the Accuserattempted to destroyXandarwith thePower Stone's incredible power, he was confronted by theGuardians of the Galaxywho were supported by theRavagersand theNova Corps. During theBattle of Xandar, Ronan's ship theDark Asterwas destroyed and he himself was killed when Star-Lord took the Power Stone's power. Gamora sealed the Stone back into the Orb and Star-Lord handed it over to the Nova Corps to be locked away for safety.[3]\n\nTony Starkfinds and takes theScepter\n\nHaving been held byWolfgang von Strucker, theScepterwas eventuallyfoundby theAvengersand taken into the custody ofTony Stark, who decided to use it in his experiments to bring life toUltron, who he planned to use to bring about a peaceful world with the help ofBruce Banner. However, the Mind Stone gave Ultron too much wisdom and gave him a vicious and bloodthirsty viewpoint of humanity itself, driving him to the point that he sought to destroy it completely.\n\nTheMind Stonegives birth to theVision\n\nDuring hiswarwith the Avengers, Ultron stole the Scepter and used it, while combining the knowledge and resources ofHelen Choand thevibraniumhe had taken fromUlysses Klaue, to create a new and powerful body known as theVision. The being was taken from him when the Avengers stole theRegeneration Cradleduring theBattle of Seoul, leading to Stark, Banner, andThorgranting the being life with the Mind Stone embedded in its skull.\n\nVisiondestroying the army ofUltron Sentries\n\nThe Vision viewed Ultron as a danger toEarthand decided to join the Avengers in fighting him. During theBattle of Sokovia, the Vision used the power of theMind Stoneagainst the overwhelming army ofUltron Sentriesand combined its power withIron Manand Thor's power to overpower and defeat Ultron, who could not match Vision's power. With the war won, Vision decided to join the Avengers and use his remarkable power to aid in the protection of Earth.[12]\n\nThoris given a vision of the Infinity Stones\n\nThorwent to theWater of Sightto see again the disturbing vision thatWanda Maximoffhad caused him to have during theBattle at the Salvage Yard. Garnering better details, Thor saw theScepterrelieved of its stone, theAether, theOrb, and theTesseractall lined up into a row. Thor then went toAvengers Towerand helped to bringVisionto life because he possessed the Mind Stone; Thor understood its relationship to the other Stones and how Vision could help in the final defeat ofUltron. Later, Thor related his knowledge that four of the Infinity Stones had been located.[12]\n\nVisionexpresses his fears toWanda Maximoff\n\nAs they were talking at theAvengers Compound,Visionexplained toWanda Maximoffthat although he knew where theMind Stonehad come from, he did not know its true nature. He said to her that the more he understood it, the less it controlled him and someday he may control it. Later, during theRescue of Wanda Maximoff, Maximoff used her powers to control the Mind Stone and push Vision many meters beneath the facility.\n\nVisionaccidentally shootsWar Machine\n\nThe next day, at the end of theBattle at Leipzig-Halle Airport,War Machineasked Vision to disableFalcon's wings with the Stone. However, the beam Vision fired accidentally hit War Machine'sArc Reactor, causing him to crash onto the ground. At the hospital whereJames Rhodeswas treated,Tony Starkapproached Vision and asked him how it had happened. Vision answered that he had been distracted, which he did not know was possible.[13]\n\nDoctor Strangeuses theEye of Agamotto\n\nHaving been stored withinKamar-Tajfor safeguarding, theEye of Agamottowas eventually discovered byDoctor Strangeduring his studies. Taking the Eye, Strange experimented with its power by creating a time loop in which he regrew an apple several times until he was discovered byWong, who warned him to stop due to the risks of using such a powerful item. Strange kept the Eye with him during hisbattlesagainstKaeciliusand theZealots, not yet using its power.\n\nDoctor Strangeuses theEye of Agamottoto defeatDormammu\n\nWhen Strange andKarl Mordotraveled toHong KongtoconfrontKaecilius, they discovered that the Sanctum located there had already been destroyed and that Kaecilius and his Zealots were successful in their plan to bringDormammuand theDark DimensiontoEarth. Strange then used the Eye's power to rebuild the Sanctum by reversing time. However, Kaecilius stopped him, almost allowing Dormammu to come to Earth, so Strangewent into the Dark Dimensionand used the Eye to trap Dormammu in a time loop.\n\nDoctor Strangereturns theEye of Agamotto\n\nEach time Doctor Strange was killed by Dormammu, time reversed until just before their confrontation, where Strange kept Dormammu prisoner, albeit at the cost of his suffering. Strange told Dormammu to end his assault and take his zealots with him in exchange for Strange breaking the loop. With the war over, Strange left the Eye in Kamar-Taj with Wong having confidence Strange could wield the Eye without abusing its power once he has mastered its powers. Until then, he cannot wear it in public.[14]Strange would soon bear the title of Master of the Mystic Arts and did eventually earn the right to wear the Eye, as was seen during his meeting withThor.[15]\n\nLokidecides to steal theTesseract\n\nWhenHelawas inOdin's Vault, she passed by theTesseractand noted that it \"[wasn't] bad,\" making it the only relic she was actually even remotely impressed by. Later, asLokiwas about to summon upSurturto causeRagnarök, he passed by the Tesseract as well and took it so he could warp himself to theStatesmanship withThorand the rest of theAsgardiansbeforeAsgardwas obliterated.[15]\n\nThanosbrandishes thePower Stone\n\nThe Mad Titan,Thanos, brandished agauntletcreated to harness the power of the Infinity Stones, having decided to personally hunt for the Stones after having lost many of his resources in his failed alliances. Along with his children, theBlack Order, he traveled toXandar, decimating the Nova Corps and Empire to acquire thePower Stonewhile alsomassacringhalf of Xandar's population as part of his goal to wipe out half of the universe.\n\nThanosacquires theSpace Stone\n\nA week later, heattackedtheAsgardianship, theStatesman, killing half the population aboard (which was already dwindling in numbers due toHela) and beating bothThorandHulkalmost to death. To stop the assault,Lokigave him theTesseract, which Thanos shattered to reveal theSpace Stoneinside. Thanos then used the Space Stone to stop an attempted assassination from Loki, whom he killed and left aboard the explodingStatesmanto continue his mission.\n\nThanosusing theReality Stone\n\nUpon arriving atKnowhere, Thanos confronted theCollectorfor theReality Stoneand was able to get it from him. Thanos used the Reality Stone to deceive theGuardians of the Galaxyand trick and capture his daughter,Gamora. Upon seeing her sister,Nebula, being tortured by their father,Gamorarevealed the hidden location of theSoul Stone.\n\nThanosobtains theSoul Stone\n\nTogether, Thanos and Gamora traveled toVormirand confrontedRed Skullwho had been teleported to the planet over 70 years ago after his brief contact with the Tesseract. Red Skull revealed the Soul Stone could only appear after one sacrificed the thing they loved most, claiming it was a trading of souls. A heartbroken Thanos tearfully threw his daughter over the cliff and she fell to her death. After a blinding light, Thanos awoke with the stone in his hand, which he added to the gauntlet.\n\nDoctor Strangeprotects theTime Stone\n\nMeanwhile,Doctor Strangehad continued to defend the Time Stone in theEye of Agamottoand placed a spell on the necklace to protect it. After a conflict withCull ObsidianandEbony Maw, Doctor Strange was captured and taken aboard their ship where he was tortured by Maw until he was rescued byIron ManandSpider-Man. The trio then traveled to Thanos' homeworld,Titan, and met with theGuardians of the Galaxy.\n\nDoctor Strangehanding over theTime Stone\n\nAfter alengthy battle with Thanos, in which the power of the Infinity Stones proved crucial for Thanos' victory, the group was defeated and Strange was forced to relinquish the Time Stone to Thanos in order to saveIron Man's life. Thanos then used the gauntlet to teleport toWakandawhere, after he was severely injured byCorvus GlaiveandProxima Midnight,Visionand the Mind Stone were located.\n\nThanosrips theMind Stoneout ofVision\n\nAt theBattle of Wakanda, Thanos used the Infinity Stones' powers to effortlessly overpower every single hero that opposed him.Wanda Maximoffwas forced to destroy theMind StoneandVisionas she held back Thanos. After briefly attempting to comfort Scarlet Witch for her grief, Thanos used the Time Stone to restore Vision by reversing the explosion.\n\nThanosfinally collects all of the Infinity Stones\n\nAfter ripping the Stone from his head, Vision died once again and Thanos finally completed the Infinity Gauntlet. Thor, with his new weaponStormbreaker, attacked Thanos with one powerful hurl of the enormous battle axe, inflicting a near-fatal injury on the Titan. Not to be deterred, however, Thanos mocked Thor before completing his goal andsnapping his fingers. Immediately after, Thanos used the damaged gauntlet to simultaneously heal himself from the battle wound and teleport to safety, having succeeded in his mission.\n\nThanossuccessfully executes theSnap\n\nA few moments later, half the population of the universe began to disintegrate.Bucky Barnes,T'Challa,Groot,Wanda Maximoff,Sam Wilson,Mantis,Drax,Peter Quill,Stephen Strange,Peter Parker,Shuri,Maria Hill,Nick Fury,Sif,Betty Ross,Erik Selvig,Jane Foster,Hank Pym,Janet van Dyne,Hope van Dyne,Laura Barton,Cooper Barton,Lila Barton,Nathaniel Barton,Monica Rambeau, andYelena Belovawere among the victims.[4][16][17][18]Thanos reappeared on a quiet forested planet. His arm was still scarred from the snap, but all of his other wounds had fully healed and he satisfactorily gazed at the sunrise with a smile on his face.[4]\n\nThree weeks later,Thanosused the power of the Stones to destroy them, reducing them down to atoms.[19]\n\nBy2023, the Infinity Stones had become public knowledge. Many people who had no prior knowledge of the Stones, such asJimmy WooandDarcy Lewis, knew about them.[17]Additionally,Kamala Khan, who also had no prior knowledge of the Stones, learned about them throughScott Lang's podcast interviews.[5]\n\nBy2024, the Infinity Stones had become part ofMidtown School of Science and Technology's history classes. Additionally, hand-drawn posters of the Stones were hung up within the school.[20]\n\nBy2025, the bookI Was There..., which was written by aS.H.I.E.L.D.agent, was released and it included a first-hand account ofTony Stark's usage of the Infinity Stones during theBattle of Earth.[5][21]\n\nTheAvengerslocate the Infinity Stones\n\nIn2023, theAvengersinitiated theirTime Heist, in which they wouldtime travelthrough theMultiversein order to acquire Infinity Stones from alternate pasts. The team conveneed at thefacilityand brainstormed the locations of the Infinity Stones in the past in order to use them to bring everyone back.Rocketshared thatPeter Quillhad found thePower StoneonMorag.Nebulaprovided thatThanoshad gone toVormirwithGamorato acquire theSoul Stone.Thorshared his story when he encountered theReality Stone. While talking about whereDoctor Strangelived,Black Widowrealized that theTime,MindandSpace Stoneswere all inNew Yorkat a very specific point. The Avengers suited up and began their mission in three teams.\n\nLokiescapes with theTesseract\n\nCaptain America,Iron Man,Ant-Man, andHulkappeared at theBattle of New Yorkand split up. Iron Man, Captain America and Ant-Man grabbed theScepter, holding the Mind Stone. But ultimately lost the Space Stone asLokigrabbed theTesseractand teleported away.\n\nAncient OneandBruce Bannerdiscuss the Infinity Stones\n\nHulk approached theAncient One, who explained he was five years too early to consult withStephen Strange. The two had a lengthy discussion where the Ancient One said taking an Infinity Stone from the past would doom that branched reality. Swearing to return the stone to the moment they took it from, Hulk explained that Strange had handed over the Time Stone to Thanos, much to the Ancient One's astonishment. Carefully removing the Time Stone from theEye of Agamotto, she stated he must have had his reason in doing so.\n\nRocketextracts theReality Stone\n\nAppearing onAsgardin the year2013, Rocket and Thor made their way toJane Foster, who was infected with the Aether. Thor found it too difficult to continue forward and ran away. Rocket acquired the Reality Stone, while Thor had an emotional talk with his mother,Frigga, who realized that he was from the future. The two had an emotional goodbye before Thor calledMjølnirto himself and traveled back to the present.\n\nNebulamanages to steal thePower Stone\n\nTraveling toMoragin the year2014, Nebula andWar Machine, waited for Peter Quill to arrive, whileHawkeyeand Black Widow flew to Vormir. After knocking Quill out, Nebula retrieved theOrband handed it to Rhodey who traveled back to2023. Nebula, however, unwillingly began interfacing withher 2014 self.Thanosbecame aware of their plan and captured the original timeline version of Nebula and had the two trade places.\n\nHawkeyereceives theSoul Stone\n\nArriving on Vormir,Red Skullappeared to Hawkeye and Black Widow, saying that only one of them could leave with the stone, while the other one had to sacrifice themselves for it. After engaging in a brief combat, due to their disagreement over who should be the sacrifice, Hawkeye jumped off the cliff but was tackled by Black Widow. The two clung to the cliff before a Black Widow released herself from Hawkeye's grip, falling to her death. With the sacrifice fulfilled, Hawkeye awoke with the Soul Stone in his hand.\n\nTony Starksteals theTesseractfrom1970\n\nTracking the Tesseract toApril 7, 1970, Iron Man and Captain America traveled toCamp Lehighand acquired the Space Stone and morePym Particles. Iron Man had a lengthy conversation with his father, and finally received a proper goodbye, even thoughHowardwas unaware of who he was. The two traveled back to 2023 and rejoined the other Avengers. Hawkeye revealed that Black Widow had sacrificed herself for the Soul Stone, and the Avengers mourned her, then got to work creating theNano Gauntlet.[19]\n\nTheNano Gauntletis created\n\nUpon creating theNano Gauntlet, Rocket, Iron Man and Hulk inserted the six Infinity Stones into the weapon. A small debate broke out on who should wield the gauntlet. Meanwhile, analternate Nebula, who had infiltrated the Avengers, created a time gateway to analternate 2014and theSanctuary IIemerged in 2023 and destroyed the Quantum Tunnel.\n\nHulkwielding theNano Gauntlet\n\nEventually, Hulk put on the gauntlet, which caused him incredible pain. Slowly raising his arm, Hulk snapped his fingers andresurrectedall living creatures whomThanoshad turned to dustfive years ago. Immediately, birds flew onto trees outside the Avengers Compound pleasing Ant-Man, and Hawkeye received a phone call from his now resurrectedwife. Before the Avengers could celebrate, theSanctuary IIrained down missiles on the Avengers Compound.[19]\n\nHawkeyeprotecting the Infinity Stones\n\nSeparated by the attack,Hawkeyefound himself in the access tunnels, along with theNano Gauntlet. After discovering a horde ofOutriders, Hawkeye protected the Gauntlet as he ran from the aliens. Once he was safe from them, analternate Nebulatricked Hawkeye to give her the Gauntlet. However, after she was killed by the originalNebula, Hawkeye picked up the Gauntlet and continued to protect the Infinity Stones.\n\nCaptain Marveltries to return the Infinity Stones\n\nWhen Hawkeye joined thebattleoutside,Captain Americatold him to get the Infinity Stones as far away from analternate Thanosas possible, butHulktold them that they needed to return the stones to their time. Passing the gauntlet fromBlack PanthertoSpider-Man, Ant-Man and theWaspwent toLuis' Vanwhich had a Quantum Tunnel that could return the Infinity Stones to their correct times.Captain Marveltook the gauntlet from Spider-Man and made her way toward the tunnel. Thanos, however, threw hisswordat the tunnel, destroying it.\n\nIron Manwields the Infinity Stones\n\nCaptain Marvel, Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man tried to prevent Thanos from grabbing the gauntlet but failed. Captain Marvel was unfazed by Thanos' attacks and stopped him from snapping his fingers again. Removing the Power Stone, Thanos blasted Captain Marvel away and once again prepared to decimate the universe only to once again be stopped, this time by Iron Man. Thanos threw Iron Man aside and snapped his fingers, stating that he was inevitable. When nothing happened, however, Thanos looked to Iron Man who had created his own gauntlet with nanotech and brandished the stones himself. Stark then snapped his fingers, resulting in Thanos and his entire army disintegrating.\n\nThe Infinity Stones before being returned to their original timelines\n\nFollowing Iron Man's funeral, Captain America, with Hulk's help, went back in time and returned the stones to their respective timelines.[19]\n\nInfinity Stones that were confiscated by theTVA\n\nWhenLokifrom analternate 2012was taken into custody by theTime Variance Authorityand escaped their confinement, he forced a TVA clerk namedCaseyto return theTesseractto him. However, when he was given the Tesseract, Loki saw that it was in a drawer that contained several other Infinity Stones from various alternate timelines. Casey then told Loki that some employees used Infinity Stones as paperweights since they were powerless inside theTime Variance Authority Office.[22]\n\nIn analternate universe, afterStrange Supremeresurrected his late girlfriendChristine Palmer, his universe began to collapse. He then sawWatcher, whom he had sensed earlier, and he begged the Watcher to help him. The Watcher refused, telling Strange that he could not interfere. The universe eventually collapsed, destroying most life in it, except for Strange, as well as most of the Infinity Stones, except for the Time Stone.[23]\n\nThezombifiedThanoswith the Infinity Stones\n\nIn analternate 2018, five of the Infinity Stones had been acquired byThanoson his quest to acquire all six Stones. After Thanos travelled to Earth to acquire theMind Stone, he became infected with aquantum virusand turned into azombie. Despite this, he was able to retain the Stones that he had acquired.[24]\n\nThe Infinity Stones inUltron's possession\n\nIn analternate universe,Thanoshad acquired five Infinity Stones and teleported toEarthin order to acquire the sixth. However, he was met byUltronwho was fascinated by the Stones and killed Thanos in order to claim them. Ultron then used theMind Stonein his forehead to destroy part of theInfinity Gauntletin order to remove the five Stones that Thanos had acquired from the Gauntlet and absorbed the Stones into his armor. After being in possession of all six, Ultron recognized the existence of other planets in the universe. He used theReality Stoneto reanimate hisarmyand led them into space. There, Ultron used the combined power of all six Stones to destroyAsgard,Sovereign,Sakaar,Ego, andXandaras well as the rest of the planets in the universe. After the universe was silent, Ultron became aware ofWatcher's presence inside theObservational Plane, as well as the existence of theMultiversewhich caused Ultron to hunt down the Watcher. Ultron used the Stones' power to break into the Plane and attacked the Watcher by blasting him with thePower Stone. However, the Watcher was able to fight back against Ultron and they battled throughout multiple universes. After the Watcher surrendered and fled, Ultron returned to the Nexus and with the Stones' power, vowed to destroy the Multiverse.[25]\n\nTheGuardians of the Multiverselearn about the Infinity Stones\n\nAfter locating theGuardians of the Multiverse, Ultron arrived at their location in an uninhabited universe and prepared to kill them using the Stones. He used the Stones' power to cause the ground they were standing on to fall hoping that they would be crushed. During the brief scuffle,Star-Lordmanaged to grab theSoul Stoneoff of Ultron's armor. When Ultron was confronted by azombifiedWanda Maximoff, he used the Stones' power to obliterate the universe that they were in. T'Challa proceeded to transport the Soul Stone to Ultron's home universe.\n\nThe Infinity Stones inKillmonger's possession\n\nHowever, when they arrived,Natasha Romanofffound them and snatched the Stone from T'Challa. Ultron arrived and tried to get the Stone back, but the Guardians fought him to keep him away from it. Eventually,Gamoragrabbed the Stone, but Ultron used theTime Stoneto freeze time to grab the Stone.Strange Supremeused his Time Stone to reverse Ultron's actions and Gamora managed to place theInfinity Crusheron him with the intention of destroying the Stones. However, the Crusher didn't work as the Stones were from Ultron's universe and the Crusher only worked on the Stones from Gamora's universe. After Romanoff shotArnim Zola's analog consciousness into Ultron via an arrow, Ultron was killed.Erik Killmongerseized the opportunity and stole the Stones in order to kill the Guardians, but he was stopped by Zola, leading to a tug-of-war between the two for sole possession of the Stones. Strange then realized that their mission was to separate the Stones from Ultron's body and trapped Zola, Killmonger, and the separated Stones in a pocket dimension with The Watcher's help.[26]\n\nAfter being freed during theBattle at the Sanctum Infinitum, Killmonger gained control of the Infinity Stones and used them to killThanos. However, he was quickly separated from them byKahhori.[27]\n\nThe Infinity Stones remain inThanos'Infinity Gauntletafter his defeat and death\n\nIn analternate 2018, four of the Infinity Stones had been acquired byThanoson hisquestto acquire all six Stones. When Thanos travelled toTitan, he was promptly confronted by theIlluminati. They killed him and left the Stones in theInfinity Gauntleton his corpse.[28]\n\nTheForbidden Lake\n\nIn analternate universe,SurterinvadedAsgard, triggingRagnarök.Odinattempted to stop him using theTesseract, but Surtur succeding indestroying Asgard. The Tesseract survived Asgard's destruction and crash landed onEarthin the territory of theHaudenosaunee Confederacy. The Tesseract broke upon impact and its energy was released into theForbidden Lake. The lake was soon discovered by nearby tribes, but when anyone tried to swim in the lake they disappeared, causing conflict to break out. The conflict left the lake's reputation permanently stained, with no one being allowed to swim in its waters.\n\nWhen Kahorri's village was attacked by theConquistadores, she came across the Forbidden Lake. She fell into the lake and was transported to theSky World. Kahhori spent time in the Sky World and learned to gain control over her newfound abilities before she decided to return to her village to stop the Conquistadores. She managed to convince the Sky World inhabitants to come with her and they helped hersaveher people from the Spanish Empire.[29]\n\nTo be added[30]\n\nTo be added[27]\n\nIn an alternate universe,Ultrongained all of the Infinity Stones and used them to destroy his entire universe. However, having never become aware of theWatcher's presence, Ultron simply remained in his destroyed universe.[31]\n\nTheMind Stone,Power Stone,Reality Stone, andSpace Stone\n\nAs the Infinity Stones are the representation of all the necessary aspects of existence, they have absolute control over the fabric of reality they represent and from it, they derive extremely powerful capabilities to be wielded and are the most powerful artifacts in the known universe. Their power keeps the stability of the universe, meaning if they were removed from their reality, said reality would suffer catastrophic consequences in time.Thordescribes the Infinity Stones as the greatest power in the universe, and \"unparalleled\" in their destructive capabilities. The power of theTime Stonewas able to render even an phenomenally powerful cosmic being ofDormammu's caliber powerless to do anything to break it. TheReality Stone's power can affect the whole universe, withMalekithintending to use its capabilities to cover the whole universe in darkness. TheSpace Stonewas thought to be capable of channeling energy sufficient to destroy a planet with thePower Stonebeing able to destroy worlds and dimensions simply via its energy making contact with their surface. EvenAsgarddeems it unwise to house two stones in one place, despite the fact that theirvaultis extremely well guarded.\n\nAugmented by the Power Stone, theDark Asterwas able to easily breach the considerable defenses that surroundedXandarwithIrani Raeldeclaring a state of emergency once she learned thatRonanwielded it. One of the greatest feats of power ever to be seen from the use of the Infinity Stones was their power to turn living beings into dust. Such power alone was the true motivation for Thanos to seek out the Infinity Stones in the first place. When all six Stones are brought together and properly channeled, they make their wielder virtually omnipotent, being able to affect the universe in almost any way they choose, whichThanosdemonstrated when he killed half of all life in the universe via asimple finger snap. Likewise, the Infinity Stones were the only way toresurrectall those who were decimated by Thanos. The combined power of all the Infinity Stones could not resurrectNatasha Romanoff, however, who had sacrificed herself so that theAvengerscould have the Soul Stone. In addition, the combined power of all the Infinity Stones could even destroy the Universe and recreate it to the wielder's image. With the power of all six Infinity Stones, analternate Ultronbecame an extraordinarily powerful cosmic being and was capable of effortlessly decimating universes. He surpassed even the might ofWatcher.\n\nTheSoul Stonewas located inVormirand had held a special place within the ranks of the Infinity Stones. According toWong's ancient texts, the Soul Stone could be the most dangerous Infinity Stone. In order to wield the Soul Stone, the Soul Stone demanded that those who seek to wield it must first sacrifice someone they loved, so as to ensure that whoever seeks the Soul Stone does indeed understand its power. The Soul Stone can manipulate the spiritual essence of living or deceased beings, making it one of the most dangerous Infinity Stones. The Soul Stone even has a pocket dimension within it calledSoulworld. Soulworld consists entirely of shallow water underneath a dim orange sky, where the souls of the dead can be communicated with.\n\nHowever, due to their sheer power, only a single being of exceptional power, or collections of lesser beings who are unified and focused in their intent, is able to wield the stones. As a result, the Stones were often placed in mediums that would allow for a limited, but more stable, access to their power such as theEye of Agamottoor theScepter. However, the Soul Stone can be held by normal humans without any additional protection, as Hawkeye held the newly-acquired Stone with only a glove as protection. Metals appear to serve as useful inhibitors for the Stones.Ultron, then formed out of a titanium alloy, was able to hold the Mind Stone in his bare hands and Gamora was instantly able to contain the Power Stone, which had been radiating massively destructive energies, with a simple, mass-produced, metallic container. The power of all six Stones can be harnessed collectively, but prior to Thanos completing theInfinity Gauntlet, this had never been accomplished, all who attempted being overwhelmed by the powers of the individual Stones. However, even the Gauntlet itself was left heavily burnt from channeling and focusing the power of all six Stones, being seemingly rendered useless after it had done this a second time.Ultroncreated theInfinity Armorto house and wield the power of the Infinity Stones without risk of harm, asKillmongerand laterCaptain Carterwore the armor and used the power of the Stones without any harm to themselves.\n\nThe Stones, due to their immense power, are nigh-indestructible with KingBorviewing even the full might of Asgard as insufficient to destroy the Aether with the same stone later being unharmed by Thor unleashing his lightning on it. The only known way to destroy an Infinity Stone is via something that possesses the same unique energy signature as the Stones themselves. In theInfinity War, Vision correctly theorized and that ifWanda Maximoffwere to focus all of her energy back into theMind Stone, the stone's molecular integrity would fail and it would be destroyed. Though she was able to do so, it still took considerable time and effort. The Stone's destruction unleashed all the energies contained within, though the resulting wave was harmless. Her powers likewise allowed her to communicate with, and to a limited extent, control the Stone, having it increase Vision's density against his will. Three weeks after theSnap, Thanos used the Infinity Stones to reduce them to atoms, although they retain their presence in the universe. In addition, Killmonger was able to use the Stones in the Infinity Armor to disintegrateThanosfrom analternate universe, who was equipped with a complete Infinity Gauntlet, also disintegrating the Stones he had in the process. The only known way to recreate a destroyed Infinity Stone is to use the Time Stone to rewind time to before its destruction.Wanda Maximoffwas also able to recreate theMind Stoneinside arecreated Vision's head via herChaos magic. Following theDestruction of Asgardhowever, Thor believed that the fully empoweredSurturhad destroyed theTesseract, suggesting that a sufficiently powerful being could destroy a Stone.Gamoraalso used theInfinity Crusherto destroy the Infinity Stones from heruniverse, though the Crusher didn't work on Stones from alternate universes.\n\nUsing the combined power of all the Infinity Stones simultaneously through the Infinity Gauntlet puts incredibly high amounts of strain on the wearer of the Gauntlet, even risking death. Should the user survive channeling the Stones' energy, they risk burning the side of their body the Stones were on. Thanos barely survived a second snapping, which he used to destroy the stones, being left severely injured and weakened, so much so that he was unable to defend himself against the Avengers when he was ambushed. Hulk was likewise able to survive a snap due to the energy released by the Infinity Stones being mostlygamma radiation, but this came at the cost of his right arm being severely injured. Hulk theorized that not even Thor, an exceptionally powerful Asgardian, would be able to survive a snap, though it should be noted that Thor was not in good physical condition at the time. The Infinity Armor, however, can seemingly be used by any being to channel the Stones' power without any risk of harm to the wearer.\n\nThe energy derived from the Stones has shown the ability to grant superhuman powers. When exposed to the Space Stone derived energies of theLight-Speed Engine,Carol Danverswas gifted with powers based on those of the Space Stone, particularly her enhanced speed and energy channeling.Kahhorilikewise was exposed to the power of the Space Stone, which granted her abilities such as energy projection and portal creation. Likewise, the energy of the Mind Stone allowed Wanda Maximoff to develop telekinetic and telepathic abilities and also granted her brother Pietro the power of superhuman speed. These powers persisted even after the Stones had been destroyed. Similarly, Vision and Ultron's Synthezoid bodies were further augmented by the energy of the Mind Stone, granting them abilities such as intangibility, flight, and the power to generate an energy beam from the Stone, which was strong enough to bisect Thanos. When Vision was rebuilt and reactivated asWhite Vision, he still retained these powers, despite no longer having the stone embedded in his forehead. The Stones can also enhance already-existing powers; the Mind Stone increased Wanda's dormant magical abilities, turning her into the Scarlet Witch and granting her Chaos Magic, tough these powers are more similar to the Reality Stone in both appearance and function.\n\nDespite their immense power, Infinity Stones, like all magical objects, are rendered powerless and practically useless when they are in theTime Variance Authority Office.\n\nEach universes' Infinity Stones are unique. The Infinity Crusher from Gamora's universe was designed to destroy her universes' stones and was unable to destroy the Stones from an alternate universe.\n\nIn chronological order:",

    "title": "A Complete Guide to MCU's 6 Infinity Stones—And Who Has Them | TIME",
    "content": "Warning:This post contains spoilers for all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films.\n\nCaptain Marvelchases after the Tesseract, the Guardians of the Galaxysteal an orb, Thortries to capture Aether. These magical objects may seem like MacGuffins, or simply plot devices that are meant to keep the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving forward. But in fact, these objects are Infinity Stones: a group of gems that grant their owner great power.\n\nThanos, an evil, purple alien, used that power to destroy half the universe inAvengers: Infinity War. Now, in theInfinity Warsequel,Avengers:Endgame, it’s up to Marvel’s heroes to reverse that damage, possibly by traveling through time and acquiring and destroying all the Infinity Stones themselves before Thanos can get his hands on them.\n\nThe complexMarvel Cinematic Universe timelinemakes it easy to forget the Infinity Stone names, let alone their powers and where you might have seen them before. After all, there are 21 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And most of the Infinity Stones have multiple names.\n\nBut we’ve got you covered. Here are answers to all of your questions about the Infinity Stones, and what role they’ll play inupcoming Marvel movieslikeAvengers: Endgame.\n\nInfinity Stones are really powerful gems that, when united, can be used to destroy people, planets, solar systems—you name it.\n\nThere are six Infinity Stones: The Space Stone (blue), the Reality Stone (red), the Power Stone (purple), the Mind Stone (yellow), the Time Stone (green) and the Soul Stone (orange).\n\nAs Benicio Del Toro’s The Collector explains inGuardians of the Galaxy, six singularities existed before the creation of the Universe. The Big Bang transformed those entities into six separate Infinity Stones.\n\nSo glad you asked. This can get confusing because many of these stones have two different names. Here’s a rundown of all the Infinity Stone names and what movies they’ve popped up in.\n\nThe Space Stone gives the user power over space. Anyone holding the Space Stone can create a portal from one part of the universe to another. In the Marvel films, the Space Stone is hidden inside a blue cube called the Tesseract.\n\nThe evil organization HYDRA used the Tesseract to power their weapons during World War II inCaptain America: The First Avenger, but the Tesseract fell out of a plane being piloted by Captain America at the end of that movie. We find out the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recovered the Tesseract from the plane during the end credits ofThor.\n\nInCaptain Marvel, which isset in the 1990s, a Kree scientist named Mar-Vell (Annette Bening) harnesses the power of the Tesseract to create an engine that can power ships to travel at light speed. Before Mar-Vell is killed by her own people, she hides the Tesseract on a ship in space. Carol Danvers (a.k.a. Captain Marvel, played by Brie Larson) recovers the Tesseract, and her feline sidekick Goose (who is actually analien called a Flerken) carries it to the office of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) at S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nIn the firstAvengersmovie, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steals the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D. and uses it to open a portal to space. An alien army streams through the portal to invade Earth. At the end of the movie, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) takes the Tesseract to his home planet of Asgard for safe keeping.\n\nInThor: Ragnarok, Thor realizes he must destroy Asgard to defeat theGoddess of Death, Hela(Cate Blanchett). As he and a cohort of sidekicks fight Hela, a supposedly reformed Loki sneaks down to the treasure room where the Tesseract (and therefore the Space Stone) is kept. We never see him grab the stone, but that dude just cannot resist creating chaos. He probably pocketed it. In thepost-credit scenes forThor: Ragnarok, we find out that someone attacked Thor’s getaway ship. InInfinity War, Thanos kills Loki and takes the Space Stone.\n\nThe Mind Stone allows the user to control the minds of others. We first see it as a blue orb in Loki’s scepter in 2012’sThe Avengers. Whenever Loki touches someone with the scepter, he can control what they do. Thanos gives the Mind Stone to Loki, which placesa lotof faith in Loki, a hilarious but not particularly accomplished villain. Weird decision, Thanos.\n\nThe Avengers recover Loki’s scepter at the beginning ofAvengers: Age of Ultron.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) use the Mind Stone to create Ultron (James Spader), an artificially intelligent peace-keeping program. Apparently, those two have not readFrankensteinbecause they’re super surprised when Ultron turns on them.\n\nAfter some bickering, the Avengers eventually use the Mind Stone to create another android, Vision (Paul Bettany). The stone gives Vision a lot of powers, including super-strength, the ability to fly and the power to phase through walls and people like a ghost. Curiously, it does not give him the ability to control minds.\n\nThe Mind Stone resides in Vision’s forehead, and the Avengers vow to protect the superhero. But when Thanos’ army overtakes Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) destroys the stone, killing Vision in the process. Thanos (who has already acquired the Time Stone at this point), simply reverses time, kills Vision and takes the stone for himself.\n\nThe Reality Stone grants the user power to manipulate matter. InThor: The Dark Worldthe villain Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) wants to use this red liquid stuff called Aether to turn matter into dark matter because he’s evil…and do you really need a better reason? It turns out that the Aether is a manifestation of the Reality Stone.\n\nAt the end of the movie, two Asgardians give the Reality Stone to The Collector because apparently they can’t keep the Space Stone and Reality Stone in the same room in Asgard. This seems to be a huge mistake: As soon as they leave the Collector says, “One down, five to go” in a super evil voice.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the Collector gave up the stone immediately to Thanos or whether Thanos killed Del Toro’s character: When the Guardians of the Galaxy arrive to take the Reality Stone from the Collector, Thanos reveals that he has beaten them to their goal. He then takes Gamora hostage.\n\nThe Power Stone bestows upon its holder a lot of energy—the sort of energy that you could use to destroy an entire planet. Star Lord (Chris Pratt) accidentally discovers the stone inGuardians of the Galaxy. Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) steals it from him and threatens to wipe out an entire race.\n\nBut here’s the tricky thing about Infinity Stones: You can’t hold them in your hand for long without dying. (More on that later.) Peter steals the stone back from Ronan and almost dies when holding it. (All the Guardians join hands, and together they can manage its power. Hooray for teamwork!)\n\nThe Guardians—you may start to notice a theme here—give it to Nova Corps, the space police, for safekeeping. The officers in Nova Corps are pretty bad at their jobs. And sure enough, by the opening scenes ofInfinity War, Thanos has already acquired the Power Stone offscreen. Thor later explains that Thanos decimated the planet of Xandar and took it for himself.\n\nThe Time Stone grants its owner the power to re-wind or fast-forward time. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) discovers it in the Eye of Agomoto pendant in the library of Kamar-Taj, where he trains in the mystic arts inDoctor Strange.He uses the stone at the end of the film to trap the villain Dormammu in a time loop so that Dormammu can’t destroy the Earth.\n\nWisely, Doctor Strange doesn’t hand over the stone to a sketchy junk collector or a hapless policeman and decides to watch over it himself. He returns the Stone to Kamar-Taj, where he currently resides, at the end of the movie.\n\nDoctor Strange wears the Time Stone throughoutInfinity Warand even tells Iron Man that if he has to choose between giving up the stone and saving the lives of the Avengers, he’ll prioritize the stone. Later, he uses the power of the Time Stone to look into the many possible futures at the end of theInfinity War.He gleans that he will have to give up the stone to Thanos in order for the Avengers to eventually defeat the Mad Titan. He does so anddisintegrates when Thanos snaps his fingers.\n\nInInfinity War, Thanos travels with Gamora to the planet Vormir, where the Soul Stone is kept. Therethey encounter Red Skull, the villain from the first Captain America movie, who has been doomed to guard but not use the Soul Stone after trying to handle the Space Stone himself. Red Skull tells Thanos that he needs to sacrifice something he loves to attain the gem, and Thanos kills Gamora.\n\nIt’s unclear what the Soul Stone’s powers are in the film universe. In the comics, the gem allows the holder to capture and control others’ souls. It also creates a separate universe where the person who wields it can trip souls. It’s possible that the people who turned to dust at the end ofInfinity Warmay simply reside in this alternate universe created by the stone.\n\nYou can’t hold an Infinity Stone for very long without dying. Just look at what happened to Red Skull. That’s why the Time Stone is in a necklace, the Mind Stone in a scepter, the Space Stone in the Tesseract, etc. Thanos needs to wear a special golden glove to hold all the stones.\n\nThe Infinity Gauntlet. Basically, it’s a fancy golden glove that can hold all the Infinity Stones. When all the stones are united in the Gauntlet, the wearer wields unlimited power.\n\nWe first see the Infinity Gauntlet in the treasure room of Asgard in the firstThor.But then we see the glove again in apost-credits scene fromAvengers: Age of Ultron. After Ultron fails to destroy the Avengers (and humanity), Thanos enters a place that is decidedly not the Asgardian treasure room, puts on the Infinity Gauntlet and says, “Fine, I’ll do it myself.”\n\nMarvel cleared up this confusion about the two Infinity Gauntlets inThor: Ragnarokwhen the villain Hela walks through the Asgardian treasury, looks at the Infinity Gauntlet,tosses it asideand declares it “fake.”\n\nIn the comics, Thanos falls in love with Death (or her physical embodiment) and collects the Infinity Stones to destroy universes and impress her. Marvel Studios hinted at this plotline way back in 2012 when a henchman told Thanos to fight the Avengers is to “court death.” Thanos smiles.\n\nButInfinity War’s writers must have changed their mind about the villain’s motivations after they filmed that scene. InInfinity War, Thanos is concerned with the overpopulation of the universe. His solution is to “restore balance” by killing off half of all the living things. “He’s evil” is another acceptable answer.\n\nThanos sent Ronan the Accuser and Loki to fetch Infinity Stones and wound up empty handed both times. He seems to be making much quicker progress by just tracking down the darn things himself. So laziness, I guess?\n\n2018, whenInfinity Wartook place, also happened to be an opportune time to attack earth, what with the Avengers team broken up.\n\nOh, yeah. If you didn’t catchCaptain America: Civil War, you may want to go back and watch it beforeEndgame. You can stream it on Netflix right now.\n\nHere’s a quick summary: Iron Man and Captain America feud over whether the government should regulate superheroes (Iron Man is for and Cap against). The rest of the Avengers take sides, minus Hulk and Thor who are too busytesting their gladiatorial skills in space. Things end badly, and Iron Man and Cap still aren’t speaking. Their breakup makes Thanos’ job all the easier.\n\nAs ofInfinity War, Captain America and Iron Man still have not united. Iron Man considered calling Cap when Thanos first landed on earth but got distracted by a mission into space to save Doctor Strange. Now, Iron Man is stuck in space, while Captain Marvel is marshaling the Avengers’ remaining forces on Earth post-snap.\n\nProbably not. Spider-Man disappeared inInfinity Warbut has asolo sequel filmpremiering shortly afterEndgame. And the supposedly deadBlack Pantherhas another movie in the workstoo.\n\nAlso note that the superheroes who did survive the culling are all part of the original Avengers team: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Most likely, this movie will be the last time that the original team fights together. They will try to find a way to undo Thanos’ destruction, probably using theQuantum Realmto time travel.\n\nDefinitely.\n\nSeveral actors’ contracts are up after this film, including Chris Evans (Captain America), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) and Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow). Evanshas been very openabout the fact that he’s ready to leave the franchise.HemsworthandDowneyhave also hinted they are done, too.\n\nBut good news: Johansson will probably survive, since Marveljust hired a writerto draft a Black Widow solo flick. Actors newer to the franchise like Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther), Tom Holland (Spider-Man) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange) are also probably safe.\n\nTo its credit, Marvel has just decided to lean into the whole “Cap or Iron Man is probably going to bite it” narrative. Feige has openly said some characters will get to ride off into the sunset, and some will meet a bloody end. It’s just a matter of whether or not that will happen inAvengers: Endgame, which hits theaters April 26.\n\nWrite toEliana Docktermanateliana.dockterman@time.com",

He intended to destroy the universe by using the Soul gems to destroy the stars. He was stopped by theAvengers, Adam Warlock andCaptain Marvel.[10][11]\n\nTheElders of the Universewere the second entities to use the gems in unison. Connecting the six Soul Gems to a device, they were able to use its beams to absorb the life energy ofGalactusand transfer it to a barren planet, giving it life. However, theSilver Surferinterfered and destroyed the machine, and the gems were lost in ablack hole.[12]Galactus also punished some of the Elders by consuming them.[13]\n\nBecause the Elders of the Universe were barred from entering Death's realm due to prior machinations of the Grandmaster, Galactus soon found himself being poisoned from within by the Elders he consumed.[14]To save Galactus, who asserted that only one of the gems had the power to absorb the immortal Elders' souls inside his body, Silver Surfer, Mr. Fantastic, and the Invisible Woman journeyed through the black hole to recover the gems, where Invisible Woman became possessed by the sentient Soul Gem and had her evil Malice persona awakened.[15]She was later subdued, but the whole scheme turned out to be work of theIn-Betweenerso he could use the gems to destroy Galactus.[16]\n\nThe gems' original shape and color\n\nReed, Sue, and the Silver Surfer were able to get into contact withMaster OrderandLord Chaos, and the two entities agreed to aid them in stopping the In-Betweener. They then used their powers to free the Elders of the Universe who were trapped inside Galactus and restore him to full strength.[17]Master Order and Lord Chaos then dealt with the In-Betweener before he caused any more trouble and entrusted five of the Soul Gems to the Elders of the Universe, while the In-Betweener was imprisoned by his masters and retained his Gem.[18]\n\nAfter being resurrected, Thanos gazed into theInfinity Welland realized the Gems' true nature, so he set out to acquire all of the Soul Gems again (now named Infinity Gems). There it was revealed that the Infinity Gems are the remnants ofone of the earliest beings from the time of the universe's creation. Feeling lonely, it split itself into six different fragments. Under unknown reasons, each individual gem became associated with a particular facet: power, space, time, mind, soul and reality.[19]\n\nPrevious owners\n\nThe Infinity Gems were kept by the In-Betweener and by members of the Elders of the Universe who, on the contrary, were not aware of the true essence of their Gems.[20]The mad Titan Thanos then gathered these gems into theInfinity Gauntlet. He took the Soul Gem from theIn-Betweener, the Power Gem from theChampion, the Time Gem from theGardener, the Reality Gem from theCollector, the Space Gem from theRunner, and the Mind Gem from theGrandmaster.[19]\n\nThanos used the Infinity Gauntlet to remove from existence half of the population of the universe in order to gainDeath's love.[21]In the end, Thanos was defeated when Adam Warlock was able to gain possession of the Infinity Gauntlet.[22]\n\nAdam Warlock was brought before theLiving Tribunalbecause of the danger posed by the Infinity Gauntlet in his hand. After being shown that Adam Warlock was too mentally unpredictable, he was required to surrender it. Since it was too dangerous for it to be possessed by anyone, the Living Tribunal decreed that the Infinity Gems were too powerful to be used together again. Warlock then formed theInfinity Watch.[23]\n\nDuring theInfinity War,Magus, Adam Warlock's evil persona, tricked Galactus into convincingEternityto agree to the activation of the Infinity Gauntlet so he could conquer the universe. Magus defeated the heroes using the activated Infinity Gauntlet. Still, Adam was able to defeat the Magus when it was revealed that the Reality Gem was a fake and Adam, taking advantage of this distraction, was able to trap the Magus in his Soul Gem, though the act left Warlock in a comatose state.[24]\n\nThe Gems were later stolen by thevampireRunefrom the Ultraverse and dispersed throughout the Ultraverse.[25]Several heroes and villains were also pulled into the Ultraverse, including Adam Warlock. In that universe, another gem, theEgo Gem, was found. It claimed that it was the main consciousness of the Infinity Gems, the original being and was now ready to reclaim itself. The gems gestated asNemesis, but were defeated by theAvengersandUltraForce(alongside several alternate reality versions of the same teams). With its defeat, the Ego Gem was seemingly destroyed.[26][27]\n\nThe gems were found to be back in the universe byGalactuswho planned on using them to end his unending hunger. He is seen taking the gems off a vampire's skeleton (presumably Rune) that he retrieves through an inter-dimensional portal. Galactus' plan fails, and instead allows a deadly inter-dimensional parasite, namedHunger, access into the Earth-616 universe who was mentally influencing Galactus' actions all along. Thanos intervened and destroyed the gateway. After Hunger is defeated, the gems are scattered throughout the universe except for the Soul Gem, which Thanos retrieved for Warlock to get back.[28]\n\nChampionwould find thePower Stoneand use it to give him an advantage over challengers he fought in his arena but agreed to stop using it whenShe-Hulktold him its a weapon, which weren't allowed during his challenges.[29]The Power Gem later fell into the hands ofTitania,[30]before being taken byShe-Hulk.[31]\n\nShe-Hulk turned the Power Gem over toMister Fantasticfor safekeeping, which prompted Reed to seek help from his fellowIlluminatito gather the remaining gems with the objective to ensure they wouldn't cause any more trouble for the Earth. Once the gems were all brought together in the Infinity Gauntlet, Reed tried to will them out of existence, but failed.Uatu the Watcherthen appeared to the Illuminati and expressed his disappointment in Reed and the Illuminati. The Illuminati then divided the gems amongst themselves. Of the Gems,Iron Manreceived Reality,Prof. XavierMind,NamorTime,Black BoltSpace,Dr. StrangeSoul, andReed RichardsPower. Due to the events following the gathering of the Gems, the Illuminati disbanded for a time.[32]\n\nAfterThe Hoodstole three of the Gems, and while looking for the fourth one, the Illuminati gathered once more and, with the Avengers' help, stopped him. After recovering once more the six Infinity Gems, they again divided the Gems among themselves (this time, Namor received the Power; Mister Fantastic, the Reality; Professor Xavier, the Mind;Captain America, the Time; Iron Man, the Space; and Dr. Strange, the Soul gems) and disbanded once more.[33]\n\nThe group assembled after theBlack Pantherdiscovered that the Earth was affected by theincursions, a multiversal phenomena that caused the periodical collision between realities.[34]In an attempt to stop the the latest incursion, the Illuminati assembled the Infinity Gauntlet. Even though Captain America managed to prevent the incursion, all the gems shattered, with the exception of the Time Gem, which simply vanished.[1]\n\nThe Time Gem unexpectedly returned some time later and transported the Avengers through time.[35]During each time jump, the Gem returned more of the heroes back to the present until only Captain America remained,[36][37]who was rescued byIron Lad.[38]Following a confrontation against Iron Lad and his future counterparts,Kang the ConquerorandImmortus, Captain America retrieved the Time Gem and used it to return to the present, though it vanished again afterwards.[39]\n\nNew colors,Eighth Cosmos\n\nFollowing thedestruction of the entire Multiverse and its eventual restoration, the destroyed Infinity Gems were recreated and scattered across the universe. TheCollectorand theGrandmasterallied themselves with theGuardians of the Galaxyto find the stones, as they believed they held the key to learn more about the destruction and restoration of the universe. This was because from the point of view of its inhabitants, this process occurred in a blink and went mostly unnoticed, and only powerful beings such as theElderscould sense traces of the mysterious re-ordering the cosmos had suffered.[40]\n\nThe Reality Stone (until then colored purple) emerged inWeirdworld, a sequestered dimension where it was known as the Wuxian Seed.[41][42]After being shattered in a dispute for its possession, the Reality Stone took the form of a dragon-shaped aether and fled from Weirdworld.[42]It re-emerged (now colored red) in a universe that was a dark mirror of Earth-616,[43]where it was later found and claimed byCaptain Marvel.[44]\n\nThe Space (now colored blue) and the Mind Stone (now colored yellow) resurfaced on Earth. The former appeared mysteriously in a S.H.I.E.L.D. storage facility, with a failed attempt fromLoki's part to retrieve it resulting in the gem ending up in the hands ofLogan.[45]The latter ended up in possession of petty crookTurk Barrett, who started using it to serve his own needs.[44]\n\nThe remaining three stones appeared scattered throughout the universe. The Power Stone (now colored purple) manifested in a giant-size in the desert planet ofXitaung, where it was found by theNova Corps.[46]The Time Stone (now colored green) restored the ruined planet ofSakaar, where it was later found by theSuper-Skrull,[47]who planned to use the Infinity Stones to remedy the humiliation theSkrull Empirehad suffered over the years. Finally, the Soul Stone (now colored orange) was located by the Magus after he forced theContemplatorto show him where it was. Magus didn't get to enjoy his success for long asUltron/Hank Pymambushed and killed him so he could claim the gem for himself, since he intended to assemble the Infinity Gauntlet and rewrite the universe.\n\nThe Infinity Stones quickly changed of owners. Logan left the Space Stone under the care ofBlack Widow;[44]the Power Stone was reduced to a handheld-size and claimed byStar-Lord;[48]the Time Stone was stolen from the Super-Skrull byDoctor Strange;[49]and finally, the Soul Gem was retrieved from Ultron's hands byWarlockwithKang's help.[50]Kang had enlisted Warlock to stop the imminent calamity caused by whomever gathered the Infinity Stones in the future.[51]\n\nGamora with the Infinity Stones\n\nAfter learning that the other Infinity Stones were on the move, Doctor Strange convened a meeting between its wielders to assemble a newInfinity Watch. The parley which took place onEarthwas interrupted byGamora, who had stolen the Power Stone from Star-Lord and used it to wage war against the other stone wielders. Gamora planned to claim all the Infinity Stones as part of a plan to reunite with a fragment of herself trapped inside the Soul Gem.[52]In the end, Gamora emerged victorious and got hold of all the stones.[53]\n\nTo prevent opposition from her quest and to feed the beingDevondra, who was responsible for the Soul Gem's hungering for souls, Gamora used the Infinity Stones to fold the universe in half and merge the two halves together before sending the new universe into a pocket dimension calledWarp Worldinside the Soul Gem. Gamora planned to create a reality once Devondra devoured all the souls inside the Soul Gem. She also sealedLokiinto the Soul Gem when he asked to be her counsel. Gamora then traveled to theGod Quarryto investigate what laid beneath it as she couldn't see past it.[54]\n\nGamora was unable to breach the barrier at the bottom of the God Quarry,[55]and she was eventually confronted by Loki and his newly assembledCosmic Avengers. Gamora had unintentionally created copies of the Infinity Stones when she brought Warp World into existence, and the Cosmic Avengers used them to escape the Soul Gem. Loki's team subdued Gamora and took the Power, Reality and Space Stones from her. Loki in turn took these stones for himself in addition to the copies of the Soul, Time and Mind Stones, thus assembling a complete set of Infinity Stones. He used the stones to send Gamora to Warp World before transporting himself to the unknown realm that existed beneath the Quarry of Creation, where he found the group of Celestials that guarded the deposit of Infinity Stones.[5]\n\nWarlock giving sentience to the Infinity Stones\n\nLoki returned from beneath the Quarry of Creation, and used his Infinity Stones to render the surplus gems inert. He handed over his set to the Cosmic Avengers so they could repair the universe. After returning to Soul World and defeating Devondra, the Cosmic Avengers joined forces with Adam Warlock to restore the universe while keeping Warp World intact within the Soul Gem. Adam Warlock then used the Soul Gem to flee Soul World with the Cosmic Avengers and his allies whileDrax the Destroyersacrificed himself to keep the portal leading to the real universe open. After sending Gamora someplace to set her on a path of redemption, Adam Warlock decided to give the Infinity Stones sentience and let them decide their destinies in order to stop the conflicts over their power.\n\nAll Infinity Stones left the Earth,[8]save for the Time Stone, which merged withHector Bautista,[56]and the Reality Stone, which merged withRipley Ryan.[57]It is later revealed that the Power Stone was swallowed byOtheronetherefore merging with it,[58]the Space Stone merged with a man calledQuantum[59]and the Soul Stone bounded to a synthetic person calledMultitude.[60]The Mind Stone choseWorldmind, but he was inevitably killed, leavingColleen Wingto take it.[61]\n\nNebula with the Infinity Gems overpowering the cosmic entities\n\nOn their own, the Infinity Stones provide great power. They form a circuit, meaning that mastery over the aspect of each Infinity Stone allows for better exploit of another. Assembled together, they create a positive feedback loop, granting the user infinite power,[5]although they only work in their native universe.[65][1]The gems are also sentient. In unison, the Gems exceedcosmic beingslikeEternityin power. In fact, the Gems allowedThanos,Nebula, andAdam Warlockto defeat almost all of the universe's major cosmic entities at the same time with ease.[66][67]The only beings that have overcome the Gems together are theLiving Tribunal[67]andGod Emperor Doomvia the power of theBeyonders.[68]\n\nThe Gems give their user virtualomnipotence,[22]as well as omniscience andcosmic awareness.[72]The user gains the power and status of a cosmic being above likes ofDeathand Eternity,[73][74]but below that of the Living Tribunal.[67]Thanos with the Gauntlet was able to usurp Eternity's role in the universe.[74]\n\nIn Battlerealm, Infinity Stones are created by channeling the energies released by the great battles of the Contest of Champions. The convoluted nature of Battlerealm, however, make them unstable and hard to control.\n\nThe first Infinity Stone native to Battlerealm (theGenesis Stone) was created byMaestrofrom the concentratedISO-8dust he left incubating inside the participants of the Contest; the second (called theEvolution Stone) was created from theDarkPhoenix's ISO-Terrigencocoon; the third (named theWar Stone) was created during the battle to preventDormammufrom conquering Battlerealm; and a fourth (theNightmare Stone) was created byM.O.D.O.K.with the help ofTaskmasterusing the data acquired from theSummoner's battles atHotel M.O.D.O.K.\n\nFollowing the Maestro's defeat at his hands,Thanostook the Genesis Stone for himself and went on a quest to acquire the others. After claiming the Evolution Stone, Thanos tried to claim the War Stone as well, butDoctor Strange, who had been investigating the Mad Titan since he vanished with the Genesis Stone, took hold of it first. Under unknown circumstances, Thanos came to be in possession of the Nightmare Stone and theStark Enhanced Spider-Manacquired a new Infinity Stone (theChaos Stone). Thanos tried to steal the Chaos Stone from Spider-Man, but Doctor Strange and other heroes of Battlerealm intervened.\n\nAfter the Infinity Stones were strewn across the Battlerealm once again due to the actions of theBlack Panther, the Goddess of DeathHelasecured the remaining Infinity Stone (theDeath Stone) and gave it to Thanos, who in turn used it to trap most of the heroes of Battlerealm in a lifeless copy of reality to gather the other five stones unopposed.[75]\n\nIn this reality, the Infinity Gems are referred to as \"Inu Abanayyartu\", or simply \"The Stones\". Their powers are unknown but presumably comparable to their multiversal counterparts.[1]\n\nIn this universe, there are eight Infinity Gems instead of six. They were generated on the Earth during great calamities, including the paleolithic extinction event,Ragnarok, theUltimatum, and the sinking of Atlantis and Lemuria, as some sort of scar tissue to help the planet.[76]\n\nFour of them were inS.H.I.E.L.D.custody.[77]A green (possibly theSoul Gem) and a purple gem (possibly theSpace Gem) were attached to aglove.[78]TheMind Gemwas stored apart inProject Pegasus, from where it was stolen byModi,[79]though it was ultimately retrieved.[80]ThePower Gemwas contained in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s The Torch facility in Sioux City, and it was stolen by Hydra double-agentCommander Crimson.[81]\n\nAfter the events centered around the Mind Gem, theInvisible Womanlearned about the other two gems in the gauntlet. She noticed the glove was designed to hold four gems, so she set out to find the fourth Gem before it fell in wrong hands.[77]Sue tried to study the gems in order to track down the fourth one, but found their spectrum analysis was inconsistent. Thor tried to talk to the gems as if they were sentient, demanding the location of the others, causing him and Sue to be teleported to a Hydra research base in New Mexico.[78]After fighting through Hydra troops, Sue discovered another gauntlet containing the fourth gem, with space for three more stones.[81]\n\nMeanwhile, the Power Gem was used by Commander Crimson to fend off her Nebraska outpost against theUltimates. An energy surge from the Gem caused Commander Crimson to disintegrate, and the gem to melt the ground and fall straight down into Earth's core.[81]The gem recovered from the New Mexico Hydra lab generated rhythmic pulsar blasts that pointed at the Moon, prompting Sue and Thor to travel there.[82]Even though they were faced by theBlack Knightof theWest Coast Ultimates,[83]the Invisible Woman managed to retrieve the Gem.[84]\n\nTheSue Stormof analternate future, who called herselfKang, traveled back in time from the destruction of her reality to the present, convinced that she would need the Infinity Gems to prevent the cataclysm she escaped from.[85]She freedHulk, andthe Makerfrom imprisonment, with the help ofQuicksilver.\n\nKang'sDark Ultimatesstruck when the present Sue Storm was briefing the rest of the Ultimates on the five Gems that had been acquired. Hulk destroyed theTriskelionand got hold of the Gems, while Quicksilver retrieved the sixth gem from the ruins of the Maker's Dome.[76]\n\nUsing the power of the almost-finishedInfinity Gauntlets, the Dark Ultimates began to reshape the world their image. As part of a desperate attempt to stand against the Dark Ultimates, Tony Stark tinkered a glove theoretically capable of attracting and containing the Power Gem that became buried underneath Nebraska. Before he could use it, Stark was neutralized by Quicksilver, because he possessed inside his brain the final Infinity Gem.[86]\n\nIron Man gets hold of the Infinity Gems\n\nReed surgically removed the Gem from Tony's brain,[87]and apprehendedJohnny Stormfrom a hospital, brainwashed him, and used his capacity to sustain enormous temperatures to retrieve the Power Gem from Earth's core.[88]After recovering the Power Gem, Pietro collected it from Johnny to hand it over to Reed. Kang had to take the Gem forcefully from Pietro, who had realized Reed planned on eradicating mutantkind when he completed the Infinity Gauntlet.[89]\n\nThe Ultimates and theHowling Commandoswere confronting Reed when Kang arrived with the Gem in order to complete the Gauntlets. They fought for the grasp of the final Gem. Kang tried to convince Reed that she needed to have the Gauntlet, otherwise the universe would end. Thanks to the intervention of Johnny Storm, who had snapped out of the brainwash, the gems fell in Iron Man's possession. In the very next moment, a tear in the fabric of reality caused by aWolverineechoed through the Multiverse, and shattered the Infinity Gems.[85]\n\nTheAvengersfirst became aware of the existence of the Infinity Stones (as they are called, instead of Gems) after theRed Skullescaped from his masterThanoswith them. The stones (excluding the Soul stone) were scattered all over the Earth shortly before his ship crashed inBrazil. He managed to maintain hold of only one of the five Infinity Stones, thePower Stone. The Avengers intercepted the Red Skull and obtained of the Power Stone, and they reactivated a secret robot created byHoward StarknamedArsenalto contain its energy in another dimension.[90]The appearance of the Stone in the Earth brought the attention of Thanos, who faced the Avengers and took the Power Stone from them, but he was subsequently blasted \"half way across the universe.\"[91]\n\nThe other four Infinity Stones were later found by the Avengers. The Time Stone was captured after fluctuating through time, and it was temporarily lodged in Iron Man'sarc reactor;[92]the Mind Stone had been seized byM.O.D.O.K., who used it to take control of S.H.I.E.L.D. and briefly switch the minds of the Avengers between each other;[93]the Reality Stone was used by theSquadron Supreme, who altered reality to their whim, but they were stopped by the Avengers;[94]and the Space Stone, which fell in possession ofLoki, who tried to use it to merge theNine Realmsand escapeValhalla.[95]\n\nAll of the four Stones were contained in the Avengers Tower, under special care by Tony Stark. However, Black Widow noticed that Tony was slowly being corrupted by the Stones. She sneaked into the vault containing the Stones and stole them with the intention to hand them over to Thor so he could take for safekeeping toAsgard. After escaping from the rest of the Avengers, who believed her to be a traitor, Widow was accompanied by Thor to Asgard, but even before handing the Stones over toHeimdall, he was corrupted, and they were forced to return to the Earth.\n\nThe duo was intercepted by theGuardians of the Galaxy, who came to the Earth to claim the stones for safekeeping. Black Widow didn't trust them with the Stones, and confronted them. The Avengers arrived to protect her, as they had realized she was right. After the Guardians were dealt with, the Avengers visitedDoctor Strange, so he could bury the Stones between realms.Dormammuarrived subsequently in order to claim the Stones, and Black Widow was forced to wield them in order to vanish him back to his dimension. After initially falling into the Stones' influence, Natasha was capable of resisting their control and reject them. However, as soon as she stripped of the Stones,Thanosreturned, and assembled theInfinity Gauntletwith the Power Stone that was already in his possession.[96]\n\nUsing the Gauntlet, Thanos created a citadel near Earth's orbit. The Avengers attempted to stop him, but the Mad Titan ignored them as he used the Gauntlet to modify Earth's climate, causing earthquakes, ice ages, and other anomalies around the globe. As part of a contingency plan, the Avengers needed to get the readings of each stone individually. By attacking Thanos' ego, they got him to use each stone alone to fight them. He first aged the Avengers until they died with the Time Stone, but Thor forced him to reverse time after causing the Titan's energy beam to backfire, aging him. After bringing them back, he used the Mind Gem to fuel them with anger and make them fight each other, however, Hulk managed to get them to focus their rage and attack Thanos, for which the Titan decided to stop its influence over them. Using the Space Gem, he attacked each Avenger by teleporting immediately after striking. Even after Hawkeye and Black Widow found the pattern of his attacks in order to avoid them, Thanos used the Reality Gem and incapacitated the Avengers, by making them see a reality where global peace was achieved. Captain America managed to see through this lie, and freed the Avengers from its influence. Once the Avengers stroke back, Thanos used the Power Stone to fight them.\n\nAfter the Avengers restrained him, Thanos decided to stop following their game, and reactivated all of the Gauntlet's power at once. He used the Gauntlet to destroy Iron Man, but it was revealed the armor was being controlled remotely, and Stark was in the Avengers Tower, using the readings of each individual stone to putArsenalback online. Thanos brought Stark's lab to his citadel, but he rebooted Arsenal, who proceeded to fight Thanos. Arsenal absorbed any attack from Thanos, and finally took the Gauntlet from him. Using the Gauntlet, Arsenal brought Thanos and the Avengers back to Earth, where the team proceeded to defeat the Mad Titan.\n\nWhen Iron Man tried to retrieve the Gauntlet from the hands of Arsenal, the robot denied Tony's action. It was revealed a backdoor left in the robot's programming allowedUltronto possess him. Arsenal was re-shaped into Ultron, and the evil A.I. revealed itself. The five Stones were drained of their power by Ultron.[97]It was later revealed that the power of the stones that were absorbed into Arsenal's pocket dimension had manifest into living copies of the Avengers that share similar memories and personalities as the originals, each capable of using a respected power of the Infinity Stones.[98]\n\nThe Soul Stone was placed onAdam Warlock's forehead, and appeared to turn dark whenever he started to exhibit negative emotions. It was the only stone Thanos did not use alongside the others on his gauntlet.[citation needed]\n\nIn this reality, the Infinity Stones were involved in one ofThanosschemes, in which he was turned into dust. Thanos came back to life and start to wore the Infinity Stones as rings, known as the Infinity Rings.[2]During Thanos' fight againstDr. Spectrum, the latter blow off Thanos's right hand with the rings.[99]\n\nSimilar to Earth-616,Thanoshad gathered the Infinity Gems and attempted to use the Infinity Gauntlet to rule the universe, but is stopped by a group of heroes.\n\nIn a later appearance, the Infinity Gems are referred to as the Infinity Stones.UltronandSigmaused the Reality and Space Stones to combine their worlds, also fusing themselves intoUltron Sigma. The remaining stones were gathered by the heroes and used to destroy Ultron Sigma with theInfinity Buster. AfterwardsThordecided that there should be six custodians to the Infinity Stones, two being entrusted to Earth, two to Xgard, and two to the Dark Kingdom.[100]\n\nThanos first obtained the Soul Stone fromAdam Warlock. He received the Time Stone from the center force field. Thanos received the Mind Stone from theGrandmasterafter the Super Hero Squad bested the Squadron Supreme in a contest. The Space Stone was found on an asteroid but was stolen byNebulaand he later took it back from her. He received the Power Stone from Nova. After the scuffle Nova used a teleporter to send the stone far away into the deepest depths of space. Thanos took the Reality Stone from the Collector and used it to get the Power Stone back. When the Silver Surfer offered Thanos theInfinity Sword, he took the Gauntlet and used the Soul Stone to trap Thanos. Using its power, the Silver Surfer became the Dark Surfer and used the Gauntlet's powers to scatter the Squaddies across six different dimensions. Afterwards, he used them to rip the Earth out of orbit. In the final battle the Surfer split himself into six differently colored copies each color corresponding with a different Infinity Stone and prepared to fight the Squaddies. As shown, each Hero Factor countered a specific Infinity Stone. After the Squaddies defeated him, the Dark Surfer sent the stones and the sword to the Infinity Pool. The Sword and the Stones were shattered into fractals once Doom and Iron Man fought. The fractals fixed what the Dark Surfer did to the Universe, and freed the beings trapped within the Soul Stone.\n\nThe factors that counter each Infinity Stone are:\n\nIn order to defeat the Mad TitanThanos,Anwen Bakianused the Reality Stone to create theDeath Stone. Looking identical to the Reality Stone, Bakian handed it over to an unaware Thanos, where it promptly disintegrated him.[101]\n\nIn theMarvel Cinematic Universe, the Infinity Gems are referred to as the Infinity Stones, which are theSpace Stone, theReality Stone, thePower Stone, theMind Stone, theTime Stone, and theSoul Stone.\n\nThe Infinity Stones in their original forms\n\nAccording to theCollector, the Infinity Stones were six different singularities existing before the beginning of the universe. Once the universe was created, they were scattered. The Stones, which could be remolded only by powerful creatures, were first used by theCelestials, who used them to grant their race unknowable power, and dominate several planets. At some point, the Celestials lost control of the Stones, and they fell into the hands of other races, such as theAsgardiansand theDark Elves.[102]\n\nTheSpace Stoneis able to generate an infinite amount of energy and generate portals to other locations and gives off a blue light. Residing in a cube known as theTesseract, it was once possessed by the Asgardians and was described as being the jewel ofOdin's treasury, but the item was eventually left onMidgard.[103]\n\nIn March 1942, duringWorld War II, theRed Skull, the leader of the Nazi deep science organizationHydra, located and retrieved the Tesseract from a church inTønsberg,Norway. With the help of his head scientist,Arnim Zola, the Red Skull used the Tesseract to supply power for the weapons used by his Hydra soldiers. Hydra's plans were foiled whenCaptain Americaand theSSRattacked Hydra's main location. The Red Skull tried to flee with the Tesseract, but Captain America was able to board his plane before it took off. When the two fought, the Red Skull was knocked into the Tesseract, causing it to react violently. The Red Skull vanished entirely when he handled the Tesseract directly, causing it to open a dimensional portal, and the object then melted through the aircraft and fell into the ocean. Captain America crashed the plane in theArctic Circle, andHoward Starkrecovered the Tesseract from the ocean floor while searching for him.[103]\n\nIn 1995, the Tesseract was studied in theProject Pegasusmilitary base byMar-Vell, in the disguise of Dr. Wendy Lawson. She and USAF pilotCarol Danverswere testing an experimental jet remotely powered by the Tesseract. The jet was attacked by the Kree, and Carol was irradiated by the blast of the destroyed engine, which gave her super powers. The Tesseract was swallowed by aFlerken, which came under the care ofNick Fury.[104]\n\nThe Tesseract remained in the custody ofS.H.I.E.L.D.(the successor organization to the SSR) until the early 21st century, when a fight between theDestroyerandThordevastated theNew Mexicotown ofPuente Antiguo.[105]Now aware of the existence of advanced extraterrestrials and fearing the threats they posed, S.H.I.E.L.D. tasked astrophysicistErik Selvigwith studying the Tesseract, hoping they could use it to develop weapons. In the following year, the rogue AsgardianLokistole the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D. forThanosin exchange for aChitauriarmy he could use to subjugate Earth. In response to losing the Tesseract, S.H.I.E.L.D. DirectorNick Furyassembled a group of heroes known as theAvengers- Captain America,Iron Man, Thor,Black Widow,Hawkeyeandthe Hulk- to stop Loki and retrieve the Tesseract. Loki had Erik Selvig, who he had hypnotized into doing his bidding, construct a device that harnessed the Tesseract's power to create a hole in space overNew Yorkfor the Chitauri to invade through. The Avengers were able to stop Loki's plans, destroy his machine, and repel the Chitauri invasion.[106]\n\nAfter the Battle of New York, Thor took the Tesseract back to Asgard,[106]andHeimdallused its power to restore theBifrost.[107]Eventually, Loki went to retrieve the Tesseract before placing the skull ofSurturinto theEternal Flamein order to startRagnarok.[108]A short time later, Thanos and theBlack Orderattacked the ship that the Asgardians had escaped on, and Loki handed over the Tesseract so that Thanos would not kill Thor.[109]\n\nTheReality Stoneis capable of warping reality to the user's desires. It was transformed into a weapon known as theAetherbyMalekith, leader of theDark Elves, who sought to use the Aether to conquer the Nine Realms before he was stopped by the Asgardian kingBor. Malekith and a small number of his followers escaped into the dark reaches of space, while Bor had the Aether hidden away to ensure that it would never be found. The Aether was later reactivated byJane Foster, who found the Stone through an anomaly inLondon, and it bonded to her. Thor brought Jane back to Asgard for her to be treated, but the realm was attacked by an awakened Malekith and his Dark Elves seeking to regain control of their weapon. The Dark Elves were repelled, but the Asgardians suffered heavy losses. Thor decided to take the fight to the Dark Elves by taking Jane and Loki with him to Svartalfheim, where Malekith extracted the Aether from Jane and bonded it to himself. Even with the Aether bonded to him, Malekith was defeated by Thor and his human allies during the convergence.[107]\n\nBelieving that keeping two Infinity Stones in the same place would be too dangerous, the Asgardians left the Aether in the care ofTaneleer Tivan, the Collector.[107]However, Thanos later traveled toKnowherein order to retrieve the Reality Stone, likely killing the Collector as well.[109]\n\nThePower Stonehas the power to destroy any living material to come into contact with it, and emits a violet light. A formerRavagernamedPeter Quill, a.k.a. Star-Lord, found the Power Stone sealed in anOrbon the planetMorag. It is unknown what happened to the Stone between its use by the Celestials and its rediscovery, much less how it wound up on Morag at all. The Stone was sought by the fanaticalKreeAccuserRonan, who agreed to deliver it to Thanos in exchange for the destruction ofXandar, home of theNova Corps, at Thanos' hands. Thanos' adopted daughterGamorawas sent to recover the Orb from Star-Lord, but she planned to betray Ronan and her father by selling it to the Collector to keep it out of their hands. However, Tivan's assistant Carina touches the stone which causes an explosion. After discovering the magnitude of the stone's power, she and Star-Lord chose to take it to the Nova Corps, but Ronan obtained it instead. However, instead of giving the stone to Thanos, Ronan decided to keep it and destroy Xandar himself. After a pitched battle, Star-Lord, Gamora,Rocket, andDrax the Destroyerwere able to separate the stone from Ronan, saving the planet. Before leaving, the newly-minted \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" gave the stone to the Nova Corps for safekeeping.[102]At some later point, Thanos retrieved the Orb and decimated Xandar.[109]\n\nTheMind Stonehas a variety of powers related to the mind, and was initially found encased in a blue crystal on thescepterwhich was given to Loki by Thanos to aid in his invasion of Earth. When removed the gem is revealed to be much smaller and emits a yellow light. Loki used the scepter to control the minds of several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, including Clint Barton and Professor Selvig. The Stone would hypnotize those who had the tip of its edge touched over their heart; however, the contact needed to be immediate, as the Stone's power failed to work on Tony Stark when Loki tapped the scepter on thearc reactorin his chest. Although the Avengers did not realize the scepter contained another Infinity Stone, or even knew what an Infinity Stone was, they recognized that the scepter emitted an energy similar to that of the Tesseract, allowing Black Widow to bypass a failsafe built into the machine Loki used to open a portal for the Chitauri to invade Earth through.[106]\n\nFollowing Loki's defeat, the scepter was kept in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, and was experimented upon by the joint organization's scientists. One scientist,Wolfgang von Strucker, who was a member of the Hydra cell growing within S.H.I.E.L.D. since the end of World War II, had the scepter transferred to his fortress inSokoviabefore Hydra's conspiracy was exposed. Strucker found that the scepter could also augment minds as well as cause spontaneous evolution in varying degrees. Hydra exposed numerous test subjects to the Stone's energy in an attempt to develop superhumans.[110]Only two of Strucker's test subjects survived: the twinsPietroandWanda Maximoff. The experiments gave Pietro a speed physiology, while Wanda was given various psionic abilities not all that dissimilar from the Stone's.[111]The Avengers, who had reunited after the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D., attacked Strucker's fortress once they received intelligence fromPhil Coulsonregarding it and the scepter's location.[112]Iron Man recovered the scepter during the battle and brought it back with him toStark Tower. Tony discovered in Strucker's files that the scepter (in reality, the Mind Stone hidden within) contained the basis for a truly artificial intelligence. Tony Stark and Bruce Banner used the scepter to developUltron, an artificial intelligence that could control theIron Legionmore effectively thanJ.A.R.V.I.S.. However, Ultron turned on his creators the instant he was brought online. Ultron believed the only way to save humanity was to subject them to an extinction-level event, forcing their evolution. The mad A.I. fled Stark Tower with the scepter and returned to Sokovia.\n\nUltron ultimately decided that he, too should evolve. Using the Mind Stone as a base for its intelligence andvibraniumfor the body, Ultron used the Stone's powers to coerce Dr.Helen Chointo using her biotechnology cradle to create a new life form. The Avengers separated Ultron from his new body while he was transferring his intelligence into it. Tony Stark uploaded J.A.R.V.I.S. into the body, but Captain America wanted to destroy it over fears it would turn out like Ultron. The matter was settled when Thor, who had seen the Mind Stone in a vision, used the power ofMjolnirto bring the android to life. Ultron's creation, now called \"theVision,\" had the Mind Stone embedded into his head, and demonstrated his worth to the Avengers when he was able to effortlessly lift Thor's hammer. The Avengers, the Vision and the Maximoff twins, with help from Nick Fury and a team of former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, put an end to Ultron's plans in Sokovia, with the Vision destroying Ultron's final body.\n\nThe Vision was made an official member of the Avengers following the battle. Before returning to Asgard, Thor told Iron Man and Captain America that the android could be entrusted with the Mind Stone.[113]\n\nWhen the Black Order came to Earth in order to retrieve the Mind Stone for Thanos, the Avengers decided to take Vision toWakanda, where they could safely try to remove the stone without risking Vision's life. When Thanos eventually arrived, Vision, realizing that they were out of time, askedWanda Maximoffto destroy the stone, even though it was still inside him. After Wanda destroyed it, Thanos used the Time Stone to reverse time, and took the stone from Vision's head.[109]\n\nTheTime Stone, which emits a green light, allows its user to manipulate time.Stephen Strangeharnessed the Time Stone within theEye of Agamottoto reverse the destructionKaeciliushad caused onHong Kong, and later to forceDormammuto leaving Earth alone by trapping Dormammu in a time loop. As Strange returned the Eye toKamar-Taj,Wongnoted he made a wise choice given the risk of walking around with an Infinity Stone.[114]However, one year later, when Thor first met Strange, he was wearing the Eye of Agamotto, which presumably contained the Time Stone, around his neck.[108]\n\nWhen the Black Order came to Earth in order to retrieve the Time Stone for Thanos, they took Strange, being unable to remove the Eye themselves. After torturing Strange to remove the enchantment on the Eye,Ebony Mawwas sucked into the vacuum of space after being tricked by Tony Stark andPeter Parker. Strange, Tony, and Peter later landed onTitan, where they met Peter Quill, Drax, andMantis. While trying to come up with a plan to defeat Thanos, Strange used the Eye to look forward in time to see over 14 million possible outcomes of the coming conflict, with them only winning in one. When Thanos arrived a battle started between him, Strange, Tony, Parker, Quill, Drax, Mantis, andNebula. Later in the fight, when Thanos was about to kill Tony, Strange handed over the Time Stone in exchange for Tony's life.[109]\n\nTheSoul Stonehas the ability to manipulate life and death. It resided on the planetVormirfor an untold amount of time. Following his attempt to abuse the Tesseract's power, the Red Skull was sent to Vormir and cursed into being the Soul Stone's guardian. At some point, Gamora found a map leading to the stone, but destroyed it so that Thanos couldn't find the stone himself. After Thanos caught Nebula sneaking onto his ship to try and kill him, he looked into Nebula's memory and found out that Gamora knew where the stone was. Thanos later captured Gamora and forced her to reveal the stone's location by torturing Nebula. After revealing that the stone was on Vormir, Gamora was brought there by Thanos to retrieve the Stone. Once they arrived, the Red Skull revealed that in order to retrieve the stone, a loved one must be sacrificed. Thanos, tearfully, sacrificed Gamora, obtaining the stone for himself.[109]\n\nHaving acquired all the stones, Thanos used them to wipe out half of the life in the universe in order to rebalance it. Three weeks later, he used them to destroy themselves, so his work couldn't be undone.\n\nHowever, five years later, the Avengers had the idea to return to different points in the past and find the Infinity Stones again in order to undo the snap. They sent different teams to get theTime, SpaceandMind Stonesin analternate 2012inManhattan, theReality Stonein analternate 2013inAsgardand theSoulandPower Stonesin analternate 2014in space.\n\nHowever, the 2012 team's plan went awry and they had to returnfurther in timein order to acquire the Space Stone andPym Particlesto return to the present.Black Widowhad to sacrifice herself to get the Soul Stone whilea past version of Thanoslearned about his future and captured present Nebula to get there. Back to the present, the Avengers managed to rebuild an Infinity Gauntlet and bring back all the people erased by Thanos five years prior, but past Thanos himself arrived shortly after and announced his intention to acquire the Infinity Stones in order to destroy the universe and recreate so that its inhabitants wouldn't fathom what came before. His plan failed as Iron Man eventually got his hands in the Infinity Stones and erased Thanos and his army at the cost of his own life.\n\nThe past Infinity Stones had to return to their proper periods of time since in case they didn't, they would unbalance the realities from were they came from and create multiple alternate timelines.[115]\n\nIn the universe that is home to the Great Society, the Infiniy Stones take on a different shape. They come in the form of \"Planes of Forever Glass\", six square-shaped panes that come in the same colors of the Stones. When brought together, they form a cube that is called the \"Wishing Box.\" The Box was used by the Great Society to avert anincursion, but the Box and the panes were seemingly destroyed in the process. This is the first instance seen of the Infinity Stones taking on a different shape and name compared to other versions in the multiverse.[3]\n\nWhen theLokiwho used the time traveler intervention to escape in 2012 was taken into custody by theTime Variance Authority, he discovered that the TVA had many Infinity Stones from various erased alternate timelines, all of which were powerless.[116]\n\nOriginally, the Infinity Gems were protected by what would be known as theInfinity Watchafter Adam Warlock won the Infinity Gauntlet and was put on trial by theLiving Tribunal, being found too mentally unstable to handle the power. The Infinity Watch remained until the gems disappeared.[119]Each member was selected by Warlock based on their unwillingness to use the Gem's capabilities or inability to either access any of it's power or full potential.[67]\n\nThe gems were later protected by the Illuminati, and each member was given a gem to hide from anybody else.[32]After the criminalThe Hoodtried to assemble the Infinity Gauntlet, the Illuminati retrieved the Gems, but switched protectors.[33]The use of theInfinity Gauntletto prevent the collision ofEarth-616with another Earth caused all the gems but the Time Gem, which just vanished, to be accidentally destroyed.[1]The Time Gem later reappeared and took theAvengerson a journey through time before disappearing after Captain America used it to return to the present.[122]\n\nFollowing the creation of theEighth Cosmos, the Infinity Stones were scattered across the universe,[40]passing through many hands before finding a group of owners that became the new short-lived Infinity Watch,[52]from whom Gamora stole all of the Infinity Stones:[53]\n\nDuring theInfinity Wars, Gamora created a pocket universe withinSoul WorldcalledWarp World, unwittingly creating duplicates of the Infinity Stones that were collected byLokiandhis allies. These were the final wielders of the Infinity Stones before Adam Warlock granted each gem their own soul so that they could live a life of their own:[5]\n\nThe original colors (from the Seventh Cosmos)",

    "title": "All 7 Infinity Stones Explained: Origin, Powers & Appearances",
    "content": "Infinity Stones are among the most iconic andpowerful weapons in the Marvel Universe. Throughout their long existence, Infinity Stones were at the center of some of thebest Marvel cosmic stories, and most recently, they have been included in the MCU as well, becoming a global phenomenon and something that marked Thanos as one of themost popular villains of all time. Starting the journey, there were six canon Infinity Stones Power Stone, Time Stone, Reality Stone, Soul Stone, Mind Stone, and Space Stone – each controlling one unique aspect of reality and combined together, controlling the reality itself. Recently, Marvel unveiled the existence of the seventh Infinity Stone, the Death Stone.\n\nDue to this, we’ve decided to revisit all seven Infinity Stones, as well as their origin, powers, and colors, to see how they varied over the decades.\n\nSpace Stone, like the rest of the Infinity Stones, was created when an entity called Nemesis, with seemingly incomprehensible powers, committed suicide. The aspects of Nemesis’ powers and personality survived in the form of the six Infinity Stones. The first time we are aware of the existence of Space Stone is when Thanos learns of the location of Space Gem, which was at the time held by a powerful entity known as Xambor.\n\nSpace Stone was part of the famousInfinity Gauntlet storyline, and later, during the Secret Wars storyline, it was destroyed when Captain America used the Infinity Gauntlets. Following the aftermath of the Secret Wars storyline, Space Stone appeared again, albeit in a different color.\n\nRegarding the color of the Space Infinity Stone, originally, it was purple. During the Secret Wars storyline, it was red. After Secret Wars, the Gem was “rebuilt” in blue, which matches the MCU color of the stone. Regarding powers, Space Stone allows its user to manipulate space and utilizeteleportationat an unprecedented level. Due to its space-manipulating properties, one can utilize Space Stone to create black holes and traverse impossible distances that seemingly break the laws of physics.\n\nMind Stone was created simultaneously with the other six Infinity Stones and traced its creation back to the Nemesis. During the Infinity Gauntlet storyline, Thanos dueled the Grandmaster to take the Gem and assemble all six of them in order to manipulate reality. Like the other gems, the Mind Stone was shattered during the Secret Wars storyline and promptly appeared again when reality recovered.\n\nAs the name suggests, the Mind Stone gives its user incredible mental fortitude and greatly increases one’s psionic powers, such as telepathy. The stone works best if the user already has some mental powers at his disposal and also if the stone is used in conjunction with the Soul Stone.\n\nOriginally Mind Stone was blue in color; during the Secret Wars, it was green. The current color of Mind Stone in the comics and in the MCU is yellow.\n\nEven though Soul Stone has the same origin story as the rest of the Infinity Stones, somehow, it ended up in the possession of High Evolutionary.High Evolutionary, in turn, gave the Gem to “Him,” aka Adam Warlock, who promptly used it to help High Evolutionary deal with New Men and other things that posed a danger to Counter-Earth. Soon Adam Warlock discovered that the Soul Gem has a dark side and sometimes acts as a vampiric weapon capable of stealing the souls of other entities and mortals alike.\n\nThanos recovered the Soul Gem from the In-Betweener, and later, the Soul Gem was like the rest of the shattered. In terms of powers, Soul Stone is capable of giving its user control over life and souls. The Gem appears to be sentient in nature and contains an entire dimension within itself called the Soul World. Using the Soul Gem allows its user to read the minds of others as well as transform creatures into their natural forms.\n\nDuring its first appearance in the comics, Soul Stone was green. During the Secret Wars storyline, it was purple, and after rebuilding, it appeared in the same color as its MCU counterpart, orange.\n\nReality Stone found itself in possession of the Collector. Thanos was able to deceive the said Collector by offering him an infant Elder in exchange for what he believed to be a worthless yellow Gem, but then used the Reality Gem to show the Collector its true power and disappeared with the Gem, leaving the Collector surprised and regretful.\n\nAs Thanos learned, The Collector was unable to unlock the powers of the Reality Stone because he lacked the mental properties to do so. Reality Stone manifests its powers only to entities that showcase enough mental fortitude to utilize the stone’s reality-altering powers.\n\nBefore the Secret Wars storyline, the Reality Stone’s powers were generally oriented toward manipulating the laws of physics and creating things and scenarios that are regarded as impossible and to “break the reality,” after the gems were destroyed and rebuilt, the Reality Stone had a brand new set of powers, and nowadays it can be used to tap into the multiverse and spy on other realities. The infinity gem is best used in conjunction with the Time Stone.\n\nOriginally in the comics, Reality Stone appeared as a worthless yellow bauble. Later, it was depicted as blue. In the MCU, the stone is red in color, which corresponds to the color of the current comic as well.\n\nDuring the Infinity Gauntlet storyline, Thanos managed to kill the Gardener in order to acquire the Time Stone. What Gardener wasn’t aware of at the time was that Thanos had Power Stone in his possession, which greatly augments the abilities of Time Gem. When it comes to the origin of the stone, it was created at the same time as the other gems when Nemesis committed suicide. It is interesting that during the Secret Wars, Time Gem was the only Gem that wasn’t “shattered”; instead, it was gone only to reappear again when Reed Richards managed to rebuild reality.\n\nThe Time Stone grants its user complete mastery over time, including the ability to view potential futures, manipulate the aging of beings, and weaponize time to entrap enemies or even worlds in endless loops.\n\nTime Stone was originally orange-colored; surprisingly, the Gem kept its color again during the Secret Wars. After the reappearance of the Gem, it was green, just like its MCU counterpart.\n\nAn unnamed Champion marks the first appearance of the Power Gem in the comics. The Champion was using the Power Gem to test his strength against the people of Tamarata without realizing its full potential. Thanos challenged the Champion and tricked him into destroying the planet by manipulating him to use the Gem’s power.\n\nThanos then offered to transport the Champion to a new planet in exchange for the Gem, which the Champion agreed to, unaware of the true value of the Gem. Like the other gems, Power Stone was destroyed during the Secret Wars storyline and consequently rebuilt by Reed Richards.\n\nWith the Power Stone, the user can access all energy and power that has ever existed or will exist and can amplify the abilities of the other gems. Its fundamental abilities include providing the user with unlimited stamina and strength, duplicating any physical superhuman power, and providing invincibility. Additionally, it can serve as an inexhaustible source of power for machines.\n\nRegarding the color, Power Stone was originally red. During the Secret Wars, it was yellow. After the rebuilding, The Power Gem turned purple like its MCU counterpart.\n\nDeath Stone is the newest Infinity Stone to be added to the rooster. Death Stone was created when Bor, Thor’s grandfather, ordered his mages to create the weapon of massive destruction so that he could crown himself the god-king of the realm. An explosion followed, and the combined might of magic and the weapon resulted in the creation of the Death Stone, a Gem that transformed a whole area of Niffleheim into an uninhabitable realm of death and decay.\n\nThe powers of the Death Stone are so far unclear, but the Gem is most likely connected to necromancy. Several powerful figures are on the search for the Gem, including Corvus Glaive, Dr. Doom, and Thor. The Death Stone allegedly holds the secret of Thanos’ return.\n\nIn terms of appearance, previous versions of the Death Stone in the Marvel comics were depicted as being golden in nature. The most recent version is supposed to be black. Death Stone is the only Infinity Gem that doesn’t share its origin story with the rest of the stones, and it shouldn’t be confused withthe non-canon “Ego Stone.”Nemsis’ suicide didn’t create Death Stone; therefore, it wasn’t destroyed and rebuilt during the Secret Wars.\n\nLatest news:\n\n© 2025 Comic Basics, a property ofIncomera d.o.o.",

    "title": "Hello - Wikipedia",
    "content": "\n\nHellois asalutationorgreetingin the English language. It is first attested in writing from 1826.[1]\n\nHello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of theNorwich CourierofNorwich, Connecticut.[1]Another early use was an 1833 American book calledThe Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee,[2]which was reprinted that same year inThe London Literary Gazette.[3]The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.[4]\n\nAccording to theOxford English Dictionary,hellois an alteration ofhallo,hollo,[1]which came fromOld High German\"halâ,holâ, emphatic imperative ofhalôn,holônto fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman\".[5]It also connects the development ofhelloto the influence of an earlier form,holla, whose origin is in the Frenchholà(roughly, 'whoa there!', from Frenchlà'there').[6]As in addition tohello,halloo,[7]hallo,hollo,hulloand (rarely)hilloalso exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.[8][9][10]\n\nBefore the telephone, verbal greetings often involved a time of day, such as \"good morning\". When the telephone began connecting people in different time zones, greetings without time gained popularity.[11]\n\nThomas Edisonis credited with popularizinghulloas a telephone greeting. In previous decades,hullohad been used as an exclamation of surprise (used early on byCharles Dickensin 1850)[12]andhalloowas shouted at ferry boat operators by people who wanted to catch a ride.[13]According to one account,halloowas the first word Edison yelled into his strip phonograph when he discovered recorded sound in 1877.[12]Shortly afterAlexander Graham Bellinvented the telephone, he answered calls by saying \"ahoyahoy\", borrowing the term used on ships.[13][14]There is no evidence the greeting caught on.[13]Edison suggestedHello!on August 15, 1877 in a letter to the president ofPittsburgh's Central District and Printing Telegraph Company, T. B. A. David:\n\nFriend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.\nWhat you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.[12]\n\nThe first name tags to includeHellomay have 1880 at Niagara Falls, which was the site of the first telephone operators convention. By 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as \"hello-girls\" because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.[14][15]\n\nA 1918 novel uses the spelling \"Halloa\" in the context of telephone conversations.[16]\n\nHellomight be derived from an older spelling variant,hullo, which the AmericanMerriam-Websterdictionary describes as a \"chiefly British variant of hello\",[17]and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting.Hullois found in publications as early as 1803.[18]The wordhullois still in use, with the meaninghello.[19][20][21][22]\n\nHellois alternatively thought to come from the wordhallo(1840) viahollo(alsoholla,holloa,halloo,halloa).[23]The definition ofhollois to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in ahuntwhen the quarry was spotted:[24][25]\n\nIf I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.\n\nFowler'shas it that \"hallo\" is first recorded \"as a shout to call attention\" in 1864.[26]It is used bySamuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poemThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerwritten in 1798:\n\nAnd the good south wind still blew behind,But no sweet bird did follow,Nor any day for food or play\n\nCame to the mariners' hollo!\n\nIn manyGermanic languages, including German,Danish,Norwegian,DutchandAfrikaans, \"hallo\" directly translates into English as \"hello\". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter fromWillem Bilderdijkto his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.[27]\n\nWebster's dictionaryfrom 1913 traces the etymology ofholloato the Old Englishhalowand suggests: \"Perhaps from ah + lo; compare Anglo Saxon ealā\".\n\nAccording to theAmerican Heritage Dictionary,hallois a modification of the obsoleteholla(stop!), perhaps from Old Frenchhola(ho, ho! +la, there, from Latinillac, that way).[28]\n\nStudents learning a new computerprogramming languagewill often begin by writing a \"Hello, World!\" program, which does nothing but issue the message \"Hello, World!\" to the user (such as by displaying it on a screen). It has been used since the earliest programs, and in many computer languages. This tradition was further popularised after being printed in an introductory chapter of the bookThe C Programming Languageby Kernighan & Ritchie.[29]The book had reused an example taken from a 1974 memo byBrian KernighanatBell Laboratories.[30]",

OnFebruary 21, 2557,[5]the vessel was officially commissioned after being refitted with technology that would add scientific and diplomatic endeavors to her capabilities.[19]ByFebruary 2558,Infinityhad a crew of 17,151 sailors,Marines, ONI operatives, and civilian personnel, as well as numerous adjunct members of the other UNSC branches and a number ofHuragokspecialists.[5][20]Infinitymay additionally embark an escort force of ten internally-dockedStrident-and laterAnlace-class frigates.[5][16][21]As ofOctober 2558, the primary shipboard AI isRoland.[22][23]The ship's motto isAudere Est Facere(To Dare is to Do).[4]\n\nIn2559, theInfinitywas presumed destroyed overInstallation 07during a largebattleover control of the ring,[24][25]although its current status is ultimately unknown.[26]\n\n\n\nAuthorised as an emergency mobile colony byProject OUROBOROS,[1]the ship was constructed in theSpecial Assembly Plant Concordlocated in theOort cloudsurrounding theSol system,[15]with construction beginning in2544.[4][27]The ship was designed by a team composed ofVice Admiral Elizabeth Sark,Commander Oscar Greyson, andDoctors Dana WolffandSada no Okuni.[1]Secrecy was ensured by having workers permanently stationed there over several years with a total communications blackout in effect. The ship's massive building expenditures, however, prevented ONI from keeping theInfinitya complete secret. Many senior members of the Admiralty, such asRear Admiral Saeed ShafiqofUNSC Procurement, were fully aware of the ship's existence at the time of her construction.[28]Eventually the Fleet took control of the vessel rather than theOffice of Naval Intelligence. Captain Andrew Del Rio took command of the ship and her pre-commission crew years prior to the end of major hostilities in the war,[15]thoughCINCONIMargaret Parangoskycorrectly predicted thatCommander Thomas Laskywould eventually supplant Del Rio.[29]\n\nAs ofMarch 2553, technology discovered onTrevelyan, ashield worldlocated in theZeta Doradus system, was planned to be incorporated into the ship.[28]Huragokassistance in refining the ship'sslipspacenavigation capabilities, in particular, was expected to push the final construction milestones far ahead of schedule.[30]Unlike older warships which had only areas such as a gym or hangar space forMarinesand Spartans to train in,Infinityis the first known vessel to include a state-of-the-art virtual reality combat deck capable of replicating environments from across the galaxy,[31]real or hypothetical, using a combination ofholography, props, and simulated sensory input fed through aneural interface.[32]\n\nA small number ofSpartan-IVsfrom the new program's first official class were assigned toInfinityin January 2553. Shortly afterward,Insurrectionistsled by the former Spartan-IVIlsa Zaneattempted a hostile takeover of the vessel, entering the ship disguised as a construction crew.[33]The attack was repelled, largely due to the efforts of SpartansSarah PalmerandEdward Davis. This incident exposedAdmiralMattius Drakeas the leader of theNew Colonial Alliance, and the Spartan-IVs' actions contributed to the establishment of the Spartans astheir own branch of service.[34]Additional Spartans were included in the ship's contingent as time progressed[15][31]and Palmer would later become the commanding officer of the ship's Spartan complement.[35]\n\n\n\nWith a number of further upgrades to the ship, theInfinitywas launched onMarch 22, 2553, with Del Rio at the helm.[37]In March,Infinityunderwent inspection byAdmiralsTerrence HoodandMargaret Parangosky. By this time many crew changes had been enacted on the ship.Dr. Catherine Halseywas put to work installing the ship'sForerunnerslipspace engines, under the supervision of Dr.Henry Glassman, the chief engineer. ManyHuragokfromTrevelyanhad been assigned to the ship, led byRequires Adjustment.Ainewas assigned to the ship as a temporary AI.[38]Parangosky met with Del Rio and Lasky, who discussed the current refit shape ofInfinity.[39]While aboard the ship, Parangosky and Hood received intel on the ongoingBlooding Years, learning thatVadam Keep, the headquarters ofArbiterThel 'Vadam, was about to be breached by theServants of the Abiding Truth. Hood contacted Vadam, who reluctantly agreed to accept Hood's help. After Glassman cleared the ship for combat, it departed for Sanghelios.[40]\n\nWhenInfinityarrived over Sanghelios,Kilo-Five'sprowlerUNSCPort Stanleydocked with the ship, and Parangosky gaveCaptainSerin Osmantwo Huragok, Requires Adjustment andLeaks Repaired, who made several refits to Kilo-Five's PelicanTart-Cart.[41]Soon, theSangheiliopposition shipDefender of Faithbegan to assault Vadam; the Elite vessel was easily destroyed.[42]The remaining Sangheili insurgent forces were all but destroyed whenInfinityfired her fore MAC gun on their positions, creating a massive crater on the Vadam coastline. Due toInfinity's help in the battle, Vadam was saved, and the battle trial was considered successful. Kilo-Five later rejoined the ship's crew.[43]\n\nThe UNSC officially commissionedInfinityinto service, publicly refocusing her mission on peace and exploration, on February 21, 2557. The following year, this date would be commemorated as \"InfinityDay\".[5]Infinitywas tasked with finding the rest of the Halo Array, and the UNSC forces managed to set up bases on Installation 03 as well as Installation 05 for studying and decommissioning the ringworlds.[44]Furthermore, theInfinitywas used to transport a massive Forerunner artifact known as theComposertoIvanoff Station, a research station in orbit of Installation 03. After an ONI team atIvanoff Stationvanished while researching the Composer, the ship's crew learned the location of theshield worldRequiem.[44]During the approach to Requiem,Infinitypicked up a distress call from theUNSCForward Unto Dawnand her two surviving crew,SpartanJohn-117and hissmart AIcompanionCortana. During the attempted rescue, the ship's control systems were hacked by theDidact, the leader of the Forerunners'PrometheanWarrior-Servants, which caused it to crash-land on the shield world's surface.[19]The Master Chief rallied scattered reconnaissance personnel and was soon reunited with Commander Lasky, whom he had met decades prior during theBattle of Circinius IV.[44]\n\nPromethean andCovenantforces boardedInfinitywhile the Didact scoured the ship's mainframe; though the ship's crew did not know at the time, he was searching for the location of the Composer. The Master Chief quickly broughtInfinity's point defenses back online, enabling her to destroy twoZanar-pattern light cruisersand to drive off the Didact'sCryptum. Shortly thereafter, Captain Del Rio ordered thatGypsy Companyneutralize a network ofparticle cannonsthat were suppressing UNSC aircraft in the area; this would allow an approach to the gravity well generator that was keepingInfinityinside the shield world, which in turn would allow the ship to return to Earth to report their findings.[45]\n\nAfter their return to the ship, John-117 and Cortana told Del Rio that they had encountered an imprint of theLibrarian; John insisted that the ship pursue the Didact before he could leave Requiem. Dismissing their claims as the result oframpancyand age, Del Rio ordered that Cortana be removed from service after she temporarily—and accidentally—disabled some of the ship's systems in a fit of rage. The Master Chief refused, and the bridge crew defied the captain's order to arrest the Spartan. Lasky then provided John aPelican gunship, requisitioning it under the pretense that it would be used to apprehend the Spartan. John jumped ship in the Pelican asInfinityescaped the shield world with Del Rio ordering a warning beacon dropped and a course set in forCarinae Station. Though John and Cortana were initially successful even withoutInfinity's help, a fit of rampancy caused Cortana to release the Didact's Cryptum from its impromptu containment structure. This allowed the Cryptum to interface with the Didact's ship,Mantle's Approach, after which the Didact set course for Installation 03 while John and Cortana pursued the Didact aboard a CovenantLich.[46]\n\nUponInfinity's return to Earth, Del Rio was relieved of command due to his abandonment of the Master Chief on Requiem. Lasky took over as commanding officer, just as Admiral Parangosky had planned.[47]In the meantime, the Didact acquired the Composer fromIvanoff Stationnear Installation 03 and integrated it intoMantle's Approach.[48]\n\nWhen the ship arrived in Earth's orbit,Infinitystood ready as the flagship ofBattlegroup Dakota, a detachment of theUNSC Home Fleet. SPARTAN-117 informed now-Captain Lasky that he intended to detonate aHAVOK tactical nuclear weaponinsideMantle's Approach, preventing the Composer from being fired against Earth. Once the ship's point-defense guns were neutralized,Infinityused two of her primary MACs to blast holes in the opposing vessel's hull. The Master Chief used one of these openings to enter the ship and eventually defeated the Didact, though not before the Composer digitized the residents ofNew Phoenix, Arizona,URNA. The ship was successfully destroyed, at the cost of Cortana's life.[47]A Pelican was dispatched to retrieve the Spartan, who then spoke with Captain Lasky before having his armor removed onSDeck for the first time in almost five years.[49]\n\nOnFebruary 7, 2558,Infinityreturned to Requiem to clear territory for UNSC research bases. The ship and hersub-vesselsquickly dispatched a small Covenant task force stationed at the entrance portal and deployed numerous dropships through the opening. A massive joint effort comprising the Navy,Army,Marine Corps,Air Force, andSpartansbegan securing areas on the surface from Covenant garrison forces.[16]After a short span of time, SpartanFireteam Crimsonsecureda Forerunner artifactfrom an area known as \"the Cauldron\" and brought it aboard the ship.[16]When the artifact began disruptingInfinity's power, artificial gravity, and propulsion, SpartanCommander Sarah Palmerwas able to disable it. Palmer, Captain Lasky, andChief Engineer Dr. Glassmanthen inspected the artifact. Palmer saved Lasky from being translocated along with Glassman to Requiem by the artifact.[50]Sometime later, Dr. Halsey was brought in to examine the artifact, much to Palmer's chagrin. Due to the artifact continuously causing problems for the ship, it then was navigated by Roland, who could accomplish little without human help.[51]\n\nSome time afterGabriel Thorne's disappearance through the translocation artifact, theInfinitywasinvadedby large numbers of Promethean Knights, followed by Covenant forces. The Covenant created havoc on board the ship, forcing theInfinityto recall all forces on Requiem to defend the ship. Fireteam Crimson was responsible for protecting the engine and server rooms, bringing the weapons systems back online, and even deactivated multiple nuclear warheads cloaked withactive camouflagestowed away on the ship, that had been earlier discovered as stolen.[52]It was later discovered that the primary goal of the boarding action was to kidnap Dr. Halsey forJul 'Mdama. Despite eliminating all boarders, theInfinityremained locked above Requiem due toa slipspace anchororiginating from the planet.[53]\n\nDr. Glassman deduced that the slipspace anchor was being generated by the Forerunner artifact aboard the ship and a pair of similar artifacts on Requiem. If the artifacts on the shield world were deactivated,Infinitywould be free. At the same time, Jul 'Mdama set Requiem to collide with its sun, with the anchor pulling theInfinityalong with it. Fireteams Majestic and Crimson were quickly dispatched to deactivate the artifacts, in which they succeeded. Once the two fireteams were aboard the ship,Lieutenant Jamesflew the ship away from Requiem on Captain Lasky's order.Infinitymade an emergency jump into slipspace as the shield world was consumed by the sun, immediately sending the star into a prematuresupernovastate. The ship emerged intact from the jump, with a number of reported injuries but no major casualties.[54]\n\nIn March 3, Fleet Admiral Terrence Hood pulled theInfinityaway from the pursuit of Jul 'Mdama and assigned the ship to escort Thel 'Vadam during negotiations onEalen IV, between 'Vadam and theJiralhanaeChieftainLydus.[55]CommanderBradleyhad taken Lasky's former place as executive officer by this time.[56]On March 5, during the negotiations,Covenant forcesled byShipmasterVata 'Gajatattacked the delegates.[55]The UNSC forces on the planet were unable to contact theInfinitybecause the Covenant were blocking the signal.[56]During the battle, Lasky and SpartanNaiya Raywere able to destroy the generator of the jamming signal and contactInfinity. As Lasky reestablished communications, Bradley informed him that the Sangheili and Jiralhanae ships were about to attack each other. However, Lasky was able to placate the crisis and the fleets eventually rallied withInfinity, forcing the Covenant fleet to retreat. The ambassadors successfully escaped the planet thanks to the sacrifices ofFireteam BaileyandPaul DeMarco, which were later commemorated in a memorial service held aboardInfinity.[57]\n\nDays later, a distress signal originating in theArtesia-702 systemwas picked up byInfinity. WhenInfinityarrived in the system on March 11, it found a damaged freighter, thePilgrims' Pride, and tugged it into one of its deployment bays. An ambush was sprung within the bay when the freighter set itself to self-destruct and multiple UNSC assault crafts exited its cargo bay. With the help of Fireteams Majestic,Colossus, andFenrir, the attack was repelled and the freighter was tugged back into space before it could self-destruct onInfinity. Following the skirmish,Infinity's after action teams discovered that the assault crafts from the freighter's attack were those belonging to the long-lostUNSCSpirit of Fire, a warship missing since February2531.[11]\n\nFollowing the lead onSpirit of Fire, Admiral Hood orderedInfinitytoOth Lodonin Jiralhanae space. Instead of the ship,Infinity's crew discovered aCovenant space stationoperated byNew Colonial Allianceinsurgents led by CaptainDaniel Clayton, the illegitimate son of theSpirit's captain,James Cutter.[58]Infinitysustained tremendous damage from three discharges of the station'sglassingweapon, including starboard-to-port hull breaches and fires on the bridge; Commander Bradley was killed and Hood was paralyzed from the waist down. However, Commander Palmer and Fireteam Majestic boarded and captured the station before another blast could be fired, instead turning the weapon on Vata 'Gajat'scorvettethat was about to destroyInfinity.[59]After the battle, theInfinitywas put under repairs and most of its staff was transferred to other duties. In mid-April 2558, over a month after the events at Oth Lodon, the ship was fully repaired.[60]\n\nInMay 2558,Infinitywas involved in an ONI-commissioned mission to capturea Sangheiliwielding a newbioweaponon the unclaimed planetVen III. Captain Lasky deployed a team of two Spartans,Gabriel ThorneandNaiya Ray, on the planet via aprowlerstored aboardInfinity. AfterInfinitylost communications with the Spartans and a UNSCspy droneon Ven III, Roland proposed thatInfinityhead toward the planet. Lasky was at first hesitant to involve the ship as he had been ordered to avoid direct engagement, but after Spartan Ray discovered an enormousKig-Yarpirateoperation shortly before being ambushed, he ordered Roland to set course for Ven III and call all Spartan teams on deck.[61]\n\nUpon arriving at Ven III,Infinitywas met by the pirates' advance fleet. The ship deployed several Broadswords to counter the fleet as well as a rescue convoy to retrieve the two Spartans on the surface.Infinitysuccessfully repelled the fleet in space whileLongswordstook out the remaining fleet on the planet as well as the pirates' base. On the surface Ray was about to retrieve the bioweapon from the Sangheili agent butONIagents arrived in order to retrieve the weapon themselves as well as detain the Elite agent. Thorne and Ray were successfully returned to theInfinitywhile Lasky and Palmer discussed ONI's intervention at the conclusion of the mission.[62]\n\nFollowing the bioweapon incidentInfinitywas deployed to assist in attack against the human colonyOban. Following the battleInfinitymade a slipspace jump towardsGalileo IIbase. However, the ship suddenly reappeared in anasteroidbelt, colliding with an asteroid and causing some damage inside the ship.Infinityjumped to slipspace again, only to reappear a quarter of a kilometer of her last position. Roland told Captain Lasky that it is was inadvisable to make another jump. Dr. Glassman discoveredInfinity's slipspace drive was overriding any coordinate except the one of the location in which they were sticking the ship in a \"Slipspace cul-de-sac\". In that moment, Roland found an unusual energy reading coming from the equator of an uncharted planet —Aktis IV— near their position. Glassman and Lasky supposed that the location was the source of the problem and Palmer ordered to gather a team and send them with Dr. Glassman to the planet. Unknown to the crew, the ship had been stranded by Dr. Halsey who used aForerunner artifactto contactInfinity's Forerunner components, including her slipspace drive, and trapped them in the system.[63]\n\nLocating the source of interference to an island on the planet, Palmer, Fireteam Majestic, and Glassman soon discovered a Forerunner artifact in a Forerunner structure. Aktis IV has an ocean consisting of an unidentified substance that was impenetrable toInfinity's sensors. After Glassman discovered that the artifact was seemingly compatible with the Janus Key, the UNSC's half of the Key was sent to the island fromInfinityfor further analysis. However, the UNSC aircraft carrying the key were shot down bySali 'Nyonand hissplinter group. In the confusion, 'Mdama's fleet, which had avoided detection by hiding in the planet's oceans, rose up and began deploying troops. As the UNSC forces on the planet retreated into the Forerunner structure,Infinitydeployed reinforcements.[12]As 'Mdama's fleet engagedInfinityin the planet's atmosphere, the vessel could not establish contact with the UNSC forces inside the Forerunner structure. Later,Infinitysucceeded in deployed at least twoMantisesto the planet's surface to battle the Covenant forces.[64]Infinityand itsStrident-class sub-vessels continued to engage 'Mdama's fleet until the battle eventually drew to a close with Jul's acquisition of both halves of the Janus Key. After picking up the UNSC forces on the surface,Infinityleft Aktis IV. Three days later, on July 23, ONI agents arrived onboard in order to interrogate Commander Palmer for her failure to secure the Janus Key and Dr. Halsey.[65]\n\nBy late 2558,Infinityhad received a full systems upgrade as well as scheduled maintenance. By this time, construction on a secondInfinity-class vessel, theUNSCEternityhad commenced. To save resources, several modules were borrowed from the incompleteEternityto supplant those on theInfinity, leading to the replacement of several non-essential weapon systems.[1]\n\nIn October 2558, UNSCInfinityserved as mission control for bothFireteam OsirisandBlue Team. After a successful assassination ofJul 'Mdamaduring theBattle of Kamchatka, Fireteam Osiris returned Dr. Halsey to UNSC custody aboard the Infinity.[66]Shortly afterward, Spartan Blue Team, led by the Master Chief, were sent fromInfinityto reclaim the lost ONI research vesselArgent Moon, but went AWOL after receiving a cryptic message fromCortanaand denyingInfinity's orders to ignore her calling toMeridian.[67]With the UNSC's most veteran Spartans having deserted, Fireteam Osiris was deployed to arrest them.[68]Osiris returned the following day, though, without Blue Team but with an account of aGuardianawakening on Meridian's surface and Blue Team having escaped on it. Having been tracking previous and current Guardian attacks,Infinitymade it their priority to track down the Master Chief by activating an inert Guardian hidden inSanghelios.[69]\n\nWith the aid ofthe Arbiterand theSwords of Sanghelios,Infinity's forces were able to activate the Guardian and deliver Osiris aboard it.[70]Their achievement and subsequent defeat of Jul 'Mdama's remnant forces came to naught, however, as Osiris followed the Guardians to the planetGenesisand discovered the constructs were part of a plan byCortanato put the galaxyunder the control of AIs. Both Master Chief and Osiris were unable to stop Cortana, and so her Guardians were released to shut down all weapons and technology across the colonies. When a Guardian was sent to pacify Sanghelios,Infinitywas still in the star system but a good ways off and fled toEarthafter witnessing what was happening.[71]However, when Cortana began theSubjugation of Earth,Infinitywas forced to make an emergency slipspace jump to avoid being taken down by the Guardians' EMP blast. With no option left to them but to run, Captain Lasky promised theInfinitywould return when the Created could be fought.[22]The UNSCInfinitywas one of the few vessels that managed to escape the Guardians.[72]At least a day after the Created began to subjugate Earth,Infinityanswered a distress call by theUNSCSentry of El Morrowhich was under attack by theWarden Eternal.[73]\n\nWhen Fireteam Osiris and Blue Team returned to Sanghelios, they learned that Halsey, using the Forerunner technology in the area, had managed to make contact with Roland, who remained loyal to humanity, aboard theInfinity. Due to needing Halsey's help to stop the Created threat, Lasky set up a rendezvous on the far side ofSubanat eighteen hundred standard time the next day whereInfinitywould remain for fifteen minutes. Usingthe Pelicanthe Spartans had escaped fromGenesison, they were able to reachInfinitywhichCaptainVeronica Darehad also joined up with.[71]Shortly after returning to the ship,Edward Buckwas sent on a classified mission with Dare to reuniteAlpha-Ninein order to contact theUnited Rebel FrontonCassidy IIIin hopes of gaining information on the Forerunner cloaking technology protecting their colony. Lasky set up a predetermined series of locations and times whereInfinitycould be found for brief periods, allowing Alpha-Nine to return to the ship after the mission. Later, while relaxing in the Full Moon bar onInfinitywith Fireteam Osiris and Alpha-Nine, Buck and Dare were married by Roland who stated that as the ship's AI, he had the same authority to perform weddings that the captain of a ship did.[74]\n\nIn October 2559, it deployed a portion of its Spartan and Marine complement intoNew Mohácsto help theViery Militiain warding off the Banished assault.[75][76]It soon jumped into slipspace following the completion of Operation WOLFE because it detected a Tau surge indicating the arrival of a Guardian.[77]\n\nIn late 2559,Infinitywas part of a UNSC fleet that was sent toInstallation 07on a mission to eliminate Cortana usingThe Weapon.Infinityarrived at Zeta Halo on December 12 and immediately fell intoan ambush, with theInfinitysustaining multiple hull breaches from the initial attack.[78]The Banished had arrived at the ring earlier, and begun fortifying the ring's surface to neutralize Cortana.[79]Four approachingBanished dreadnoughtsattacked the supercarrier and overwhelmed its defenses.[80]Multiple Banished raiding parties, including one personally led byAtriox, stormed the ship.[78][81]With the boarders making rapid progress, John-117 took charge of escorting Captain Lasky from the bridge to the hangar bay for evacuation, and was aided along the way byFireteam Taurus.[82][83][84]Although the hangar was being overrun by Banished by the time Lasky's group reached it, an intact dropship was secured, and as Lasky departed for the surface of Zeta Halo he declaredInfinityhad been compromised and issued the order for all remaining crew to abandon ship.[85][86][87]\n\nFollowing the evacuation order,Infinitywas rammed amidships by aBanished dreadnoughtand sustained severe damage. Shortly afterward, John-117, who had stayed aboard and continued fighting in the hangar, was confronted by Atriox and flung out into space; both he and the Banished leader were presumed killed in action since contact with them was lost. Meanwhile, aconflictbetween UNSC survivors and the Banished for control of Zeta Halo unfolded on the ring's surface.[88]\n\nInfinitywent missing following the battle, and while its status is unknown,[26]the surviving UNSC personnel believed it to be destroyed.[89]Escharumlater claimed that the flagship of the UNSC had been neutralized in only four minutes.[25]\n\nFrom stem to stern,Infinityhas a length of 5,694.2 meters (18,681.6 feet), a beam of 833.3 meters (2,733.9 feet), and a height of 1,041.2 meters (3,415.9 feet). This makes her the largest warship the UNSC Navy has ever commissioned, surpassing previous record holders such as thePunic-class supercarrier.[31][90]and among the largest starships built by humanity ever.  Among contemporary vessels her length is surpassed only by the Covenant's 29-kilometerSh'wada-pattern supercarriers[91]and the Sangheili's 6.3-kilometerLursu-pattern brigantines, though by Forerunner standards she qualifies as a mere destroyer.[92]For transportation throughout the enormous vessel,Infinityis equipped with a high-speedtramsystem.[51]\n\nHer hull is covered in 4.9 meters oftitanium-A3 armor. The ship also one of the first UNSC vessels to possessenergy shields, a byproduct of extensive reverse engineering of Covenant shielding and improvements in human development. The combination of armor and shields is strong enough to withstand direct impact with a CovenantMaugen-pattern armored cruiserwhile sustaining negligible damage.[16]The ship's sublight power plant is aXR2 Boglin Fields: S81/X-DFR, afusion-powered set of one primary and two secondaryrepulsor engines.[4]This entire city-sized engine module took fifteen years to design, build and test.[1]Translightpower is provided by aMark X Macedon/Z-PROTOTYPE #78720HDSmounted on a remote carriage.[2]The latter is of Forerunner design and origin, capable of dropping out of slipspace with pinpoint accuracy.[51]It is also capable of powering itself by drawing upon foamingvacuum energy, which powers it independently of the ship's powerplants. As the alien slipspace drive is not compatible with UNSC standard power and data feeds, a series of Engine Module Interlinks - interlocks based on Covenant control restrictors - are fitted.[1]TheInfinityis also waterproof.[93]\n\nIn late 2558, theInfinityunderwent a major refit that included the replacement of several non-essential systems along with major works to the hull.[1]\n\n\n\nAs of February 2558,Infinityhad an official complement of 17,151. This included 8,900 Navy personnel, 5,400Marines, 750ODSTs, 1,700ONIagents, 480 civilianUEGpersonnel, 8Huragok, and 24Swords of Sangheliosmembers. These are organised into a Marine Expeditionary Division and a drop battalion for the ODSTs, which are then subdivided into five task forces, each of which can operate independently.[1]She also houses hundreds ofSpartan-IVsled byCommander Sarah Palmer; the ship's S-deck, affectionately known as \"Spartan Town\", is dedicated to their use and features a number ofBrokkr Armor Mechanismsfor mounting and dismounting armour. Additionally, 800 ofArmyand 200Air Forceassets were assigned to the ship during hersecond tour on Requiem.[16][Note 2]TheInfinityis almost completely self-sufficient, boasting facilities and comforts normally only seen on colony support ships.[1]\n\nMass deployment is realized through a large number of bays located throughout the vessel.Infinityhas 275 Cat-1 primary bays, 140 Cat-2 secondary bays, 108 Cat-3 matériel deployment bays, and ten Cat-8 sub-vessel deployment bays: the last of these each carries aStrident-class heavy frigateor anAnlace-class light frigate. Single deployment is afforded by 329R1295 Launching System/M9407 SOEIVsand 124 B854 Jettison Bays/M8823 HEVs. Emergency escape vehicles include 8,900SKT-29 Class-8 Enclosed Heavy Lifeboats/Controlledand 12,750RLT-85 Emergency Shuttlepods.[5]\n\nInfinityis also equipped with sizable recreational areas, including a large atrium-like memorial park. Located under an enormous transparent dome,[94]the park has a self-contained biosphere complete with plants and animal life and has been said to surpass many natural parks onEarthin size.[95]Garden plots and activity centres are also found here, with the ceiling being host to an artificial skydome.[1]Among other crew amenities, the ship contains a bar known as theFull Moon.[74]For training purposes, severalWar Gamestraining arenas can be aboard. Among them includes the second-largest military simulation and test environment in the human sphere. The Science Deck of theInfinityis home to state-of-the-art laboratories and research facilities, provided by ONI and theWatershed Division.[1]\n\nIt is unclear whetherInfinityhas a permanent escort formation apart from her internally docked sub-vessels, though on occasion she has been accompanied formations comprising as many as dozens of vessels. An escort fleet consisting of roughly two dozenParis-class heavy frigatesand a dozenAutumn-class heavy cruisersaccompaniedInfinityon her first mission to Requiem, though only two of the frigates are known to have arrived along with their parent ship;[96]they may have been destroyed when the shield world's artificial gravity well was activated.[19]ElevenAutumn-class cruisers (includingUNSCSong of the East)[97]accompaniedInfinityat some point between her return to Earth (ca.July 2557) and return to Requiem (February 2558).[98]At least threeVindication-class light battleshipswere dispatched to the planet along withInfinityduring the UNSC's second expedition there.[99]\n\nInfinityis equipped with a highly-advanced sensor andholographicimaging suite derived from Forerunner technology discovered onTrevelyan.[100]The system uses a combination of various shipboard sensors and imaging from orbital drones to produce a hyper-accurate real-time image of a planetary surface in the ship'sholotanks, such as thebridge's main holotable.[101]Infinityalso features 16 channel slipspace wavecom datalinks forsuperluminal communications.[4]Infinity's aft sensor array is equipped with a long-rangehyperscannerand a ForerunnerLuminary.[1]\n\nInfinity's primary armament is four 27 meter boreCR-03, Series-8 magnetic accelerator cannonscapable of firing various sub-caliber rounds, cargo packages, and autonomous kill vehicles with specialized payloads.[4]Infinityboasts a significant missile network that can be implemented for ship-to-ship combat, and anti-air defense, orbital gunfire support for Marine forces, among other uses. Emplaced throughout the ship are 1,100 missile pods of three types:Archer,Rapier, andHowler. TheM42 Archer missileprovides secondary armament forInfinitywith 350 pods of 24 missiles each. Additional missiles include theM75 Rapier(250x30 missiles) and theM96 Howler(500x20 missiles).

    "content": "\n\nHalo Infiniteis a 2021first-person shootergamedeveloped by343 Industriesand published byXbox Game Studios. It is the sixth mainline installment in theHaloseries,[1]followingHalo 5: Guardians(2015). The game's campaign follows the humansupersoldierMaster Chiefand his fight against a mercenary organization, known asthe Banished, on the Forerunner ringworld Zeta Halo. Unlike previous mainline entries in the series, the multiplayer portion of the game isfree-to-play.\n\nInfinitewas intended to release as a launch title for theXbox Series X/S, but was delayed in August 2020 after its gameplay reveal in July 2020 drew negative feedback from both critics andHalofans.[2][3]Following anopen betarelease of the multiplayer component on November 15, 2021, coinciding with the franchise's 20th anniversary, the campaign was released on December 8, 2021, forWindows,Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.\n\nHalo Infinitereceived generally favorable reviews from critics, with some deeming the game a return to form for the series. Praise was directed towards its visuals, gameplay, open world design, soundtrack, and story.\n\nHalo Infiniteis afirst-person shooter. In the game's story mode, players assume the role ofplayer characterMaster Chief, as he wages a war against the Banished, an alien faction.[4]Players traverse theopen worldZeta Halo, fighting the Banished with a mixture of vehicles and weapons. Players also have access to special equipment, such as the Grappleshot, which pulls Chief towards foes, retrieves items, or help to traverse the terrain.[5]\n\nThecampaign mode's semi-open worldstructure allows players to freely explore parts of the ring-world Zeta Halo setting, which are segmented off from each other and initially impassable. Scattered across the environment areForward Operating Bases(FOBs), which can be captured once cleared of enemies. Captured bases serve as fast-travel points.[5][6]Other points of interest found across Zeta Halo's surface include \"high-value targets\" to eliminate, Marine squads to rescue, and Banished propaganda towers to destroy.[7]Completing these side objectives earns the player Valor, which is used to earn weapons and vehicles that players can call in from FOBs.[5][6]The more linear environments within the ring's surface hew more to traditionalHalomission design. These missions serve to advance the story, and can be replayed once completed via the in-game TACMAP.[8]Collectibles found in the environment, such as audio logs, provide additional story details.[9]\n\nInfinite's multiplayer component featuresdeathmatch,capture the flag, and other modes played in standard 4-versus-4 and Big Team Battle variants; the latter bumps the player count in matches up to 24.[10]Ability pickups allow players to activate special powers a limited number of times. Powers include dashing, active camouflage, and \"repulsor\" charges that can knock enemies, projectiles, and vehicles back.[11]A training mode allows players to test weapons in weapon drills, or play against computer-controlled bot players in practice matches.[12]\n\nHalo Infiniteis set in the year 2560. During the events ofHalo 5: Guardians, the human artificial intelligenceCortanaand allied artificial intelligences (AIs) rebel against their creators, the United Nations Space Command (UNSC). Taking control of ancient Forerunner weapons known as Guardians, Cortana subjugates the galaxy. Also fighting against Cortana and the UNSC are theBanished, a mercenary organization composed of aliens and humans led by the BruteAtriox.[13]The game is set on the Forerunner ringworld Installation 07 (Zeta Halo), which has mysteriously suffered damage. The player character, Master Chief Petty OfficerJohn-117is a UNSC \"Spartan\" supersoldier on a mission to neutralize Cortana, his former partner.[14]\n\nIn addition to the narrative told in the campaign,Halo Infinite's multiplayer component features a seasonal story that centers on Spartan Commander Laurette Agryna's efforts to lead a new generation of Spartan supersoldiers in the aftermath of Cortana's attacks on various UNSC military strongholds.[15]\n\nIn December 2559, the UNSC shipInfinityarrives at Halo Installation 07. Upon arrival, the ship is ambushed by several dreadnoughts that are operated by the Banished. While defending the ship's hangar bay from multiple raiding parties, the Master Chief is caught off-guard by Atriox, the leader of the Banished, and is subsequently defeated in a one-on-one duel. Atriox throws the Chief from the edge of the hangar bay, leaving him stranded in space.\n\nSix months later, a UNSC pilot recovers the Chief adrift in space. While the Pilot wants to flee, Master Chief insists on continuing the fight against the Banished. The Chief and Pilot travel to Zeta Halo, which has been severely damaged by an unknown calamity. On the ring, Master Chief locates the Weapon, an AI designed to imitate Cortana in order to capture her for deletion. While the Weapon states that she was successful in her mission, she has failed to self-delete as per her directives. Master Chief retrieves the Weapon, and experiences visions of Cortana's memories and thoughts left as residual data.\n\nZeta Halo is controlled by the Banished, now led by Atriox's lieutenant Escharum after Atriox's apparent death. The dying Brute is invigorated to have Master Chief as his final opponent. Master Chief, the Weapon, and a reluctant Pilot rally scattered UNSC forces on the ring's surface, while looking for any Spartans that haven't been picked off by The Hand of Atriox, Escharum’s team of Spartan killers. Inside the Forerunner installation known as the Conservatory, Master Chief encounters Despondent Pyre, the AI caretaker of Zeta Halo. Despondent Pyre attempts to warn Master Chief of a threat contained on the installation, but is destroyed by the Harbinger, an alien awoken by the Banished. The Harbinger claims that her people, the Endless, were imprisoned by the Forerunners on Zeta Halo. She has allied herself with the Banished in order to rebuild the Silent Auditorium, a facility that will allow her to free her people. The Banished, in turn, will use the repaired Halo as a weapon against humanity.\n\nMaster Chief defends the pilot from a duo of Spartan killers deployed by Escharum. The Pilot reveals that he was a civilian engineer aboardInfinitywho stole a Pelican to flee the battle. The Chief comforts him, admitting his own guilt over his failure to save Cortana. Master Chief and the Weapon stop Zeta Halo's repair process by disabling a series of spires on the ring, but are unable to stop a section of the Auditorium from being rebuilt. When the Harbinger attempts to hack the Weapon, the Chief activates a failsafe to delete the AI. The Weapon repels the Harbinger and deactivates the failsafe, angrily asking why Master Chief does not trust her. After seeing a vision in which Cortana uses the Guardians to destroy the Brutes' home planet of Doisac, the Weapon realizes that she is a copy of Cortana, and insists that Master Chief delete her so she does not become like her predecessor; Master Chief refuses, stating that he wants to trust her. The Pilot is captured by Jega 'Rdomnai, an Elite Spartan killer and a close friend of Escharum, as bait for Master Chief. Unwilling to let the Pilot die, Master Chief infiltrates the Banished facility and saves him, defeating Jega 'Rdomnai and Escharum in the process.\n\nMaster Chief and the Weapon rush to the Auditorium to stop the Harbinger. The two learn that Cortana was captured by Atriox after the Weapon locked her down; upon realizing that Atriox intended to access the ring's secrets, Cortana destroyed herself, damaged Zeta Halo, and prevented the Weapon from being deleted. In a recorded message, Cortana says goodbye to the Chief and encourages him to work with the Weapon. The Chief defeats the Harbinger, but is unable to stop her from contacting someone regarding the Endless. Afterwards, the Weapon and Chief reunite with the Pilot, who reveals his name is Fernando Esparza. The Weapon decides to choose a name for herself.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the surviving Atriox uses a key to unlock a sealed door, leading to the Endless. If the game is finished on Legendary difficulty, the scene features dialogue between Despondent Pyre and a Forerunner official about the imprisonment of the Endless. When Despondent Pyre states that she cannot oversee the study of the Endless alone, the Forerunner replies that the AI Offensive Bias has been deployed to assist her.\n\nIn late 2552, during theCovenant's assault on Earth,[b]a young woman named Laurette Agryna sneaks around the streets ofLondon, attempting to evade Covenant patrols. She is spotted by a pack of Brutes, but is saved by a group of Spartans. Agryna later joins the UNSC military and eventually goes on to join the Spartan-IV program. Seven years after the fall of the Covenant,[c]in the wake of Cortana's attack on Laconia Station and the disappearance of both the Master Chief and the UNSCInfinity,[d]Agryna—now serving as a Spartan Commander—begins training a new generation of Spartans and establishes new training facilities on classified frontier worlds, such as theAvery J. Johnson Academy of Military Science.\n\nMeanwhile, during a reconnaissance operation to a former UNSC shipyard on the planet Camber, Spartans Sigrid Eklund and Hieu Dinh discover that the Banished have created their own AI construct, named Iratus. The construct detects Eklund and Dinh's presence in the yard and alerts the Banished, forcing the duo to hijack a Banished Phantom in order to escape. Iratus, however, follows them and attempts to lock down the Phantom's flight controls. In order to regain access to the flight controls, Dinh allows Iratus to infect his neural interface, leaving him unconscious. After returning to the Academy, Eklund informs Agryna of their encounter with Iratus. While Agryna devises a plan to pull the AI construct out of Dinh's neural interface, Iratus attempts to break Dinh by forcing him to relive his memories ofOperation: Interior Exile—a botched UNSC attempt to secure Forerunner artifacts that resulted in numerous deaths. Agryna's plan eventually succeeds and Iratus, along with a complete archive of the Banished's operations on Camber, is secured, saving Dinh's life in the process.\n\nAfter the capture of Iratus, Agryna begins to prepare her Spartan recruits for a larger conflict with the Banished. While practicing at the Academy's firing range, Eklund expresses concern over Dinh's state of mind after the incident on Camber, but Dinh assures her that she and Agryna have nothing to worry about. Some time later, Dinh—alongside an unnamed Spartan recruit,[e]discovers an entry point to a secret underground base, built by the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) at the beginning of humanity's war against the Covenant. Dinh reveals to the Spartan recruit that he received his first set of UNSC armor at the base, before realizing that Iratus may have been attempting to learn the location of the ONI base from him. Moments later, Iratus hijacks the base's power systems; he declares that the base's secrets now belong to the Banished and takes control of a set ofSPIarmor.\n\nDeveloper343 IndustriesproducedHalo 4(2012) andHalo 5: Guardians(2015) as part of the \"Reclaimer Saga\", a series of games initially planned as a trilogy.[16][17][18]Halo Infinitewas developed by 343 Industries with assistance fromSkyBox Labs, Sperasoft,The Coalition,Certain Affinityand Atomhawk.[19][20][21][22][23]\n\nThe studio played with the idea of makingHaloan open world game, drawing inspiration from other video games such asThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, with the idea of allowing to explore a large open area, with the freedom of completing the game in any order.[24]\n\nWhile reception toHalo 5was overall positive, the campaign received criticism for not including enough of Master Chief; 343 Industries promised to refocus on the character going forward.[25][26]\n\nIt utilizes the new Slipspace Engine.[27][28][29]The game was written by Paul Crocker, who was also associate creative director of the campaign.[30][31]Justin Dinges and Nicolas Bouvier were chosen as artists.[30][32]The multiplayer component of the game was directed by Tom French, Associate Creative Director of multiplayer, and Pierre Hintze, Project Lead and Partner Head of multiplayer.[33][34]The tools used for the Slipspace Engine used basic development tools called Faber. Some parts of Faber dated back to the early 2000s, having also been used forBungie'sHalogames. As a result, its coding became notoriously difficult to use by 343 Industries, being consideredtechnical debt. 343 Industries had also excessively relied on hiring contract workers to the point of making up half the studio according to estimates. Due to Microsoft's policy that limits contract workers to keep their jobs for up to 18 months, the number of workers at 343 Industries gradually fell.[24]\n\nHalo Infinitewas beset by further issues during development. The game suffered from creative instability for some time; the studio was described to be split into \"fiefdoms\", and that the struggle to complete the game and the conflicting decisions resulted in \"four or five games being developed simultaneously.\"[24]Two-thirds of the planned game was cut by summer 2019, which severely removed some of the initial vision. Despite this, the planned deadline of November 2020 to be a launch game for the Xbox Series X/S was decided to be impossible to meet.[24]Development director Frank O'Connor stated in August 2019 thatHalo Infinitewas being built \"so it plays and looks fantastic\" on Xbox One, but would have enhancements when played on Xbox Series X/S.[35]\n\nThe gameplay reveal on July 23, 2020, saw criticism from the gaming community for the game's visual quality, which saw further changes to development.[24]On August 27, 2020, 343 Industries announced thatJoseph Staten, the former lead writer and cinematic director of theHaloseries at Bungie, had joined as Campaign Project Lead forHalo Infinite.[36]343 Industries later announced that Staten's role had changed to Head of Creative forHalo Infinite.[37]Staten had convinced Microsoft to delay the game to 2021 in order to release a stable launch. He had provided a list of reasons why the game would be better if the deadline was pushed. When the game was delayed, features were added and improved, including the graphics.[38]On October 28, 2020, Bloomberg News reported that (now former) Studio Head Chris Lee had departed the project.[39]\n\nHalo Infinitewas intended to have split-screen campaign co-op in response to the backlash of its removal inHalo 5: Guardians,[40]but the feature was delayed several times and was ultimately cancelled by September 2022.[41]The game supports bothcross-platform playand cross-platform save progression between Xbox and Windows versions.[42]Campaign network co-op was eventually included as part of the Winter Update in November 2022 along with several other features, including the ability to replay old missions via the in-game TACMAP, which was absent from the game's release.[8][43]\n\nThe music forHalo Infiniteis a collaboration betweenGareth Coker,[44]Curtis Schweitzer,[45]Joel Corelitz,[46]Alex Bhore,[47]and Eternal Time & Space, overseen by 343 Industries Music Supervisor Joel Yarger.[48]Infinite's soundtrack was released digitally on December 8, 2021, in two albums, one covering the score for the campaign,[49]and another covering the music for the game's multiplayer component.[50]An additional soundtrack album, featuring music written forInfinite's post-launch seasons, was released on February 23, 2024.[51]\n\nHalo Infinitewas announced in a trailer atE3 2018with its release confirmed, at the time, for Xbox One and Windows.[52][53][54][55]The developer said that all of the scenes in the trailer were running in-engine.[56][57][58]During E3 2018 it was confirmed thatInfinitewas planned to have a beta prior to its release, described as an insider flight program.[32]\n\nAtE3 2019the following year,Halo Infinitewas confirmed that it would be a launch game for the next-generation Xbox consoles.[59][60]In January 2020, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty confirmed that the studio had no immediate plans for Xbox Series X exclusives at launch, preferring to phase out compatibility with older hardware over a longer period, similar toPCs.[61]TheCOVID-19 pandemicforced developers toremote work.[62]After the Xbox Games Showcase on July 23, 2020, 343 Studio Head Chris Lee stated that a public beta was unlikely due to the impact of the ongoing pandemic,[63][64]despite Microsoft stating at E3 2018 that there would be a public beta ahead of launch.[65]343 Industries said that the game would receive a freeray tracingupdate post-launch.[66]On July 31, 2020, it was announced that the game's multiplayer portion would be released as afree-to-playgame.[67]\n\nOn August 11, 2020, it was announced that the game had been delayed to an undefined date in 2021,[68][69][70]due to a range of factors impacting development, including the COVID-19 pandemic.[71]Microsoft initially planned to split the game into several parts but ultimately decided against it. It was reported that 343 Industries was heavily outsourcing the game to external developers, resulting in development troubles, and was a contributing factor to the delay.[72]Speaking toIGN, a spokesperson for 343 Industries denied that theHalo TV showwas having an impact onHalo Infinite'sdevelopment, butIGNstated that \"the spokesperson did not speak to the report's claim that 'a significant portion of the game is being outsourced to third-party contractors.'\"[73]\n\nIn December 2020, 343 Industries announcedHalo Infinitewould be released in late 2021,[74][75][76]later giving a December 8, 2021, release date.[77]\n\nA technical test for the multiplayer portion of the game ran from July 29 – August 2, 2021, where select members of the Halo Insider Program could compete in teams across three maps against bots in 4v4 Slayer mode.[78]On August 20, 2021, it was announced that the game would be launching without campaign co-op, a longtime feature of the series. It was also announced thatForge, a creative environment where players could design their own maps and gametypes, would not be available at launch.[79]On August 25, 2021,Infinitewas announced to be releasing on December 8, 2021.[80]Additional testing \"flights\" ran September 23–26 and September 30 – October 3, with the first round centered around 4v4player-versus-playermultiplayer,[81]and the second introducing 12v12 Big Team Battle on the larger map Fragmentation.[82]343 used player feedback during the flights to make changes to the game before release.[83]\n\nOn October 25, 2021, 343 Industries published a video depicting the game's campaign mode for the first time since its initial panned debut in July 2020; the footage offers a first look into several previously untold aspects of the mode's gameplay and plot.[5]\n\nOn November 15, 2021, anopen betaofHalo Infinite's multiplayer aspect was released on Windows, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in celebration of theXboxand theHaloseries' 20th anniversary.[84]The game wasreleased to manufacturingon November 19, 2021.[85]Halo Infinitereleased on December 8, 2021.\n\nAs the industry expositionE3 2020was canceled due to theCOVID-19 pandemic,[86]Microsoft revealed the first gameplay footage ofHalo Infinitevia livestream. On June 24, 2020, the officialHaloYouTubechannel premiered a teaser titled \"SIGNAL DETECTED. TAG DESIGNATION: FOE\",[87]which featured an audio clip of an anonymous character who representsthe Banished, a faction introduced inHalo Wars 2.[88]\n\nAmong the merchandising tie-ins for the game wasMonster Energy Drink, a \"Moa burger\"-flavored version ofPringles, andDr. Squatch\"Spartan Soap\". Participants can earn a variety of in-game weapon skins, player nameplates and weapon emblems. There are also several augmented reality experiences throughSnapchatas part of the promotion.[89][90][91]\n\nCoinciding withInfinite's gameplay reveal was a trailer, \"Step Inside\", produced by 215 McCann, who had previously worked on the\"Believe\" campaign forHalo 3. The spot, showing Master Chief's armor being made, was the kickoff to a wider campaign, \"Become\", which focused on how the events of the games are shaped by ordinary people in theHalouniverse.[92][93]\n\nAtE3 2021, Microsoft unveiled two new trailers for the game, one showcasing the multiplayer campaign and the other a general story trailer.[94][95]\n\nOn August 25, 2021, a CGI trailer for the first season ofInfinite'smultiplayer mode was released, focusing on the backstory of the new character Commander Agryna in an occupiedLondon.[15]\n\nMicrosoft created anInfinite-themed console andElite Wireless Controllerto tie in with the game's release. Other tie-in hardware included hard drives, keyboards, mice, and a limited number ofHalo-themedRadeon RX 6900graphics processing units.[96][97]\n\nFollowing the campaign gameplay reveal forHalo Infiniteon July 23, 2020, publications and audiences expressed disappointment over the graphics and performance.[2]Eurogamerwrote that \"Halo Infinitelooks like the fake plastic trees version ofHalo, like a video game designed with Mega Bloks in mind. It pops in all the wrong places. [...] It doesn't feel grounded. It doesn't feel like it has depth. It feels, well, surface level, smooth and uninteresting.\"[3]Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox marketing, responded in an interview withInside Gaming:\"Listen, we're in the middle of a global pandemic. It's July, we're far from [launch in] Holiday, you're seeing a work-in-progress game.\" He said that the final game would be a \"visual showcase\".[98][99]Narrative experience director Dan Chosich tweeted: \"I want you to know your voice matters + is heard [...] I always want to live up to the legacy that Bungie pioneered. I personally care a lot about honoring that.\"[100]\n\nA screenshot of the gameplay showing an attacking Brute with a deadpan expression, given the moniker \"Craig\" by internet commenters, became aninternet meme, and was embraced by 343 Industries' community director Brian Jarrard.[101]When 343 Industries released improved gameplay videos closer toHalo Infinite'srelease, they included shots that purposely showed an improvement in visuals and appearance of \"Craig\", which character and combat director Steve Dyck and character art lead Bryan Repka considered a \"glow-up\", and that the community response to \"Craig\" was \"one of the factors in gaining some more time to finish work and get Brutes to a place where the team is happy with them\".[102]A reference to \"Craig\" in the form of anEaster eggwas added toHalo Infinite'scampaign.[103]\n\nIn October 2020, 343 Industries announced changes to the player color system inInfinite, replacing the system of primary and secondary colors in pastHalogames with \"coatings\" based on layers of patterns and markings designed to enable \"greater player expression\". 343 plans to make coatings available throughmicrotransactionsas well as rewards for purchasing tie-in products such asMonster Energydrinks,Mondelez-branded snacks, and other items.[104]The plan was received negatively, with fans and critics expressing concern about the impact of microtransactions.[105][106]343 Industries' community manager John Junyszek defended the system, stating that it enabled \"greater detail and variation\" and that other methods of obtaining coatings would be made available as \"special rewards\" in addition to paid purchases.[107]\n\nIn contrast to the game's initial gameplay reveal,Halo Infinite's multiplayer beta release in August 2021 received praise, particularly for its gameplay improvements.[108][109][110]The multiplayer'sBattle Passsystem, however, received criticism for its slow progression;[111][112]in response, 343 adjusted the battle pass progression to speed up progress.[113]\n\nHalo Infinitereceived \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according toreview aggregatorwebsiteMetacritic.[115][114]GamesRadarsummarized it by saying \"Haloas you've never seen it before\"[121]andEurogamercalled the release ofHalo Infinitein the series \"the best it's been in a decade\".[127]\n\nTechRadarwroteHalo Infinitewas \"a triumph\", saying \"From its captivating story to its liberating gameplay, developer 343 Industries has created a campaign that will resonate with veteranHalofans and inspire a new generation of players.\"[128]IGNbelieved theHaloseries to still belong amongst the best shooter games, especially praisingHalo Infinite's single-player campaign[129]and multiplayer, though considered the rewards gained in the latter's Battle Pass to be lackluster.[130]The game's use ofopen worlddesign and greater player freedom in certain areas received particular praise from others.[131][132][133]Additionally,GameSpoteditor Jordan Ramée praised the game's newgrappleshotfeature and rewarding single-player progression system.[120]\n\nPCMagcomplimented the soundtrack for providing \"a mix of atmospheric exploration music, thrilling combat tracks, and songs and compositions that exist somewhere in between\".[125]PCGamesNpraised the feel of each gun and engaging variety of the arsenal, saying \"switching to the plasma rifle to knock the shield off a Jackal and then back to the VK78 Commando to get a snappy headshot never gets old\".[124]While praising the combat,PC Gamerwere mixed on the level design of \"lush forests, valleys and marine-rescue setup\", finding it strongly evoked the mission Halo fromCombat Evolved, but felt inferior to \"the timeless design of The Silent Cartographer, or evenHalo 3's less-fondly remembered meat labyrinth, Cortana\".[123]Rock Paper Shotgunliked the world design, but criticized the plot as being held back by prior entries, \"Infinite's story is still ankle-clamped by the overindulgence of its predecessors, even though it does what it can to shrink things down into a tighter, more coherent spacetale\".[134]\n\nThe game was selected byGame Informeras theirGame of the Year.[135]\n\nBy January 2022,Halo Infinitehad reached 20 million players.[136]",

    "content": "\n\nHalois amilitary science fictionvideo game seriesandmedia franchise, originally developed byBungieand currently managed and developed byHalo Studios(previously 343 Industries), part ofMicrosoft'sXbox Game Studios. The series launched in November 2001 with thefirst-person shootervideo gameHalo: Combat Evolvedand its tie-in novel,The Fall of Reach. The latest major installment,Halo Infinite, was released in 2021. Spinoffs includereal-time strategyandtwin-stick shootergames.\n\nBungie began as a developer of computer games for the Macintosh platform. After the company was acquired by Microsoft in 2000, their in-progress game, which started life as areal-time strategy game, becameHalo: Combat Evolved, afirst-person shooterexclusive to Microsoft'sXboxvideo game. Following the success ofHalo, Bungie developed additionalHalosequels before and after regaining its independence from Microsoft in 2007. Microsoft established 343 Industries to overseeHalogoing forward, producing games itself and in partnership with other studios.\n\nHalo: Combat Evolvedwas the Xbox's flagship \"killer app\" and cemented Microsoft as a major competitor in the video game console space, and its sequels pioneered online matchmaking, social features, and video game marketing. The games have sold more than 81 million copies worldwide. With more than $6 billion in franchise sales,Halois one of thehighest-grossing media franchises of all time, spanning novels, graphic novels, comic books, short films, animated films, feature films, fan-made shortmachinimaanimations andother licensed products.\n\nMany millions of years ago, a species known as the Precursors assumed the Mantle of Responsibility – the guardianship of life in the galaxy. The Precursors chose an ancient form of humanity as their successors, over another species known as the Forerunners. In retaliation, the Forerunners attacked their former masters and drove the Precursors into extinction. Instead of fighting back, the Precursors allowed themselves to die, with some turning into dust intended to spread and later transform into themselves once again. This dust eventually became defective, infecting and contorting organisms into a new parasitic species, connected by a hivemind to the minds of the last Precursors: theFlood. TheForerunnerssent the humans to Earth, reverting them to a primitive civilization based in Africa, and fought the Flood, which spread through an infestation of sentient life and overran much of theMilky Way Galaxy. Exhausting all other strategies, the Forerunners conceived theHalo Array— ring-shaped megastructures and weapons of last resort that would destroy all sentient life in the galaxy to stop the Flood. A civil war began between the Forerunners' commander, known as the Ur-Didact, who wanted to assimilate all the humans on Earth into his army as AIs, thus immune to the Flood, and his wife, the Librarian, who created the Ark, an instrument that was to shelter sentient species outside the galaxy and allow for the mass creation of Halo installations which could all be activated simultaneously. The Librarian, along with all the remaining Forerunners, trapped her husband inside a Forerunner repository of knowledge known as the Domain, and disappeared as the Array was activated, thus destroying all sentient life in the galaxy and ending the outbreak of the Flood— though some Forerunners are known to have left the Milky Way galaxy for a different, unknown galaxy.\n\nNearly a hundred thousand years later, in the 26th century, humanity—under the auspices of the Unified Earth Government, or UEG, and their United Nations Space Command, or UNSC— has colonized many worlds thanks to the development of faster-than-light \"slipstream space\" (i.e.,hyperspace) travel. Tensions between the government and colonies desiring independence sparked violent clashes. The UNSC's Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) created the SPARTAN-II Project to create an elite group of enhancedsupersoldiersto suppress the rebellions covertly. In the year 2525, human worlds came under attack by atheocraticalliance of alien races known as theCovenant, whose leadership declared humanity heretics and an affront to their gods: the Forerunners. The Covenant began a genocidal holy war. Their superior technology and numbers proved to be decisive advantages; although effective, the Spartans were too few to turn the tide of battle in humanity's favor. After the Covenant invaded Reach in 2552, the UNSC's last major stronghold besides Earth,Master Chief John-117was left as one of the few remaining Spartans.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Halo rings prompts a desperate battle against the Covenant, who believe they are instruments of transcendence, not destruction. Master Chief and his artificial intelligenceCortanaare instrumental in the destruction of a Halo ring to stop the Covenant and the threat of the Flood. The assassination of one of the Covenant high prophets, turmoil within the Covenant, and the revelation of the Halo Array's true purpose leads to civil war. The disgraced former Covenant Sangheili commander known as theArbiter, along with many of his species, helps the humans stop the Prophet of Truth from activating the Halo Array via the Ark. The Human-Covenant War ends, though new conflicts begin to emerge throughout the universe.\n\nIn the post-war era, the UNSC trains a new generation of Spartans, and tensions between the UNSC and colonist rebels resumes. The Master Chief and Cortana accidentally free the Didact and he briefly returns to assert supremacy over humanity. Master Chief and Cortana halt his plans, although Cortana is initially believed dead in the attempt. Cortana's survival through the Domain leads her to break with the UNSC and assert a newhegemonyover the galaxy, with artificial intelligence (the \"Created\") in control.[1]After two years of a scattered war between Cortana and the UNSC, Cortana attacks the Banished, a mercenary organization largely led by the Jiralhanae species. The Banished win the resultant conflict, terminating Cortana and battling the UNSC for control of Zeta Halo.[2]\n\nVideo game studioBungiewas founded in 1991 byAlex Seropianin Chicago, Illinois, who partnered with programmerJason Jonesthe following year to market and release Jones' gameMinotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete. Focusing on theMacgame market because it was smaller and easier to compete, Bungie became a preeminent game developer on the platform, releasing the successfulMythandMarathon. Bungie began development on a new game in 1998, referring to it by the temporary code names \"Monkey Nuts\" and later \"Blam!\" after Jones could not bring himself to say the previous codename to his mother.[3][4]: ix\"Blam!\" was conceived as a science fictionreal-time strategygame and took place on a hollowed-out world called Solipsis. The planet eventually became aringworldcalled \"Halo\", in turn giving the game its title.[3]\n\nAs the development team began experimenting with incorporating vehicles with realistic physics simulations, they began moving the distant third-person camera closer to the action. Bungie decided it would be more fun to directly control units than direct them, and the game shifted to a third-person shooter.[3][5]Halowas announced on July 21, 1999, during theMacworld Conference & Expo. The title of the game was finalized only days before it was announced at Macworld.[5]\n\nBungie was undergoing financial difficulties, andMicrosoftwas looking for games for its upcomingXboxvideo game console. In June 2000, Microsoft announced their acquisition of Bungie, andHalo—now having morphed into afirst-person shooter—became a launch title for the Xboxvideo game console.[3][5]Relocated from Chicago to Redmond, Washington, Bungie had roughly 14 months to finish the game before the Xbox launched. The story slowly began to take shape, with an internal debate at Bungie over how much personality to give the main character. WriterJoe Statenwanted to do more than have the player character be an \"empty vessel\" likeHalf-Life'sGordon Freeman, so they wrote him with a sense of humor. Deciding he should be referred to by his naval rank, Bungie decided on \"Master Chief\". Despite a difficult and hectic development schedule,Halo: Combat Evolvedshipped as a launch title for the Xbox on November 15, 2001.[3][5][6]: 112–113The Xbox's marketing heavily featuredHalo, whose green color palette meshed with the console's design scheme.[7]Halowas a critical and commercial success, selling alongside half of every Xbox sold.[8]By July 2006, the game had sold 4.2 million copies and earned $170 million in the United States.[9]\n\nHalo: Combat Evolvedintroduced many elements common to the franchise. Players battle enemies on foot and in vehicles to complete objectives across a mysterious alien landscape.Halolimited the number of weapons players could carry to two, forcing them to carefully select their preferred armament.[10]Players fight with ranged and melee attacks, as well as grenades. Bungie referred to the \"weapons-grenades-melee\" format as the \"Golden Triangle ofHalo\".[11]The player's has health measured inhit pointsthat must be replenished with health packs, but also has a perpetually recharging energy shield.[12]\n\nWhileHalohad not been intended as a franchise, the Bungie team wanted to make an ambitious sequel, looking to story and gameplay ideas that had been ultimately cut fromCombat Evolved, and inspired by how fans had received the game.[5][13]In particular, Bungie was surprised by how many fans used theSystem Linkcapability to network consoles together and play multiplayer inLAN parties. With the launch of theXbox Liveonline multiplayer service, Bungie wanted to bringHalomultiplayer to the internet.[13]\n\nHalo 2, was announced on August 8, 2002, at Microsoft'sX02press event,[14]and an impressive demo of the game was shown at Electronic Entertainment Expo the following year. The demo showed off new features like dual-wielding weapons and hijacking enemy vehicles, but behind the scenes the game was undergoing a troubled development; Bungie had to scrap the ambitious graphics engine as it would not run effectively on the Xbox hardware, leadership changes resulted in more infighting, and artists and designers wasted time developing assets that would ultimately not ship in the game. A planned massive multiplayer mode was entirely cut, leading to developerMax Hoberman's smaller-scale local mode becoming the only multiplayer offering. As the game's release date slipped, the studio entered a sustained period of crunch to finish the game, with other Bungie games being canceled and their staff absorbed into theHaloteam.[3][5][13]The final act of the game had to be cut entirely in the rush to complete the game.[5]Halo 2was released on the Xbox onNovember 9, 2004, and later forWindows Vistaon May 17, 2007.[citation needed]Part of the marketing took the form of analternative reality game,I Love Bees, centered around a website apparently hacked by a mysterious intelligence. Over the course of the game, audio clips were released that formed a narrative set on Earth betweenHaloandHalo 2.[15]Halo 2was a critical and commercial success, grossing $125 million in the first day and becoming the highest-grossing release in entertainment history up to that point; it would ultimately sell 8 million copies, becoming the best-selling Xbox game.[citation needed]Halo 2was also a significant motivator for subscriptions to the Xbox Live multiplayer service.[16]\n\nFrustrated by the development ofHalo 2and wanting to move on to new non-Haloprojects, Bungie wanted to wrap things up in a satisfying manner withHalo 3. Burned out byHalo 2, Jason Jones went on an extended sabbatical, and theHalo 3effort started without direction as no one was definitively in charge. Designer Paul Bertone recalled that the large development staff (70–80 people) meant more meetings and less efficiency. Multiple staff members temporarily or permanently departed the development team, including Hoberman, who started his own studio,Certain Affinityafter developingHalo 3's online systems. Despite the difficult development, overallHalo 3's development went more smoothly thanHalo 2.[5]Halo 3was announced at the 2006Electronic Entertainment Expo,[17]and released on theXbox 360on September 25, 2007.[citation needed]It added new gameplay elements, including deployable equipment and heavy weapons.[18]The game also added a limited map-editing tool, known as Forge, which allows players to insert game objects, such as weapons and vehicles, into existing multiplayer map geometry.[citation needed]A saved films feature allowed players to record gameplay and review it from any angle.[19]Backed by an extensive marketing campaign,Halo 3was a critical and commercial success, grossing $170million in the U.S. in the first 24 hours.[20]The game was the best-selling title of the year in the U.S., and the fourteenth best-selling game of the2000s.[21]\n\nLingering dissatisfaction with Bungie's acquisition by Microsoft in 2000 and a desire for more favorable profit-sharing onHalo 3led to an agreement where Bungie would become an independent studio after shipping a set number of newHalogames.[5]Bungie announced their independence in October 2007.[22]They were contractually obligated to produce two moreHalogames as part of the deal. One project turned into the gameHalo: Reach, while the other was initially going to be a production withPeter Jackson's Wingnut Interactive. When that project was scrapped, Bungie took elements prototyped for it and added them to a smallerHalo 3expansion, originally titledHalo 3: Recon.[5]\n\nProduced using theHalo 3engine and assets and with a smaller staff of only around 20 full-time employees,Recon—later renamedHalo 3: ODST—was conceived as a noir detective story, with the player character uncovering clues in a hub world that triggered playable flashbacks. The player had flexibility to explore and play missions in any order. Bungie staffers recalled that getting resources for the game was tough, as most of the studio's attention was onHalo: Reach.[5]In the game, players assume the role of weaker Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODSTs) rather than Spartan supersoldiers; lost health must be replenished with scrounged health packs. A VISR mode illuminates dark environments and highlights friends and foes, and the player is equipped with new equipment, such as silenced submachine guns and pistols. In addition to shipping with the completeHalo 3multiplayer,ODSTalso added a cooperativesurvival modecalled Firefight, where players fight against waves of enemies with limited lives.[citation needed]Halo 3: ODSTreleased September 22, 2009, and was positively received, though its price as a full game, rather than a cheaper expansion, was occasionally criticized.[5][23]It was the top-selling title of the month in the U.S. and ultimately sold more than three million copies worldwide.[citation needed]\n\nTired of focusing on the character of Master Chief, Bungie castHalo: Reachas a prequel toCombat Evolved, taking place on the doomed human world of Reach as it falls under attack from the Covenant.[5]The step backwards in the timeline was mirrored by the gameplay, which Bungie wanted to harken toCombat Evolvedwith more open environments and exploration, and the return of health packs.[23]Among the new additions were the replacement of single-use equipment with persistent armor abilities that enables sprinting, jetpacks, or temporary invincibility.[24]The game's release was preceded by an beta to help balance the game and squash bugs.[25]Reachreleased September 14, 2010 and was a success, making $200 million its first day and selling more than 4.7 million units by September 2011.[26][27]\n\nWhile Bungie finished their association withHalo, the rights to the franchise remained with Microsoft.[22]Bonnie Ross, Xbox general manager at the time, recalled that her colleagues feltHalowas a waning property and wanted to outsource new game development,[28][29]: 21:45–23:00while Ross argued for an internal studio.[29]: 26:15–27:05Ross' vision won out, and she was put in charge of a new internalHalostudio, 343 Industries, named after the character343 Guilty Spark.[30][31][32][33]The studio started with a small staff in late 2007.[29]: 28:22\n\nWhile 343 Industries worked with Bungie onODSTandReach, the new company's first game project wasHalo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, aremasterof the franchise's debut title. The game was developed in partnership withSaber Interactive, with 343 Industries handling creative and Saber the engineering.[29]: 29:00–30:55Saber had just one year to develop the game in anticipation ofCombat Evolved's tenth anniversary.[34]Players can switch between the original graphics and updated visuals with a button press.[35]Both classic and new graphics are presented inhigh-definition,16:9widescreen compared to the original game's480iresolution and4:3aspect ratio.[36]Certain Affinity helped develop multiplayer maps for the game, beginning a long collaboration between the two studios.[5]Reviews were generally positive,[37]though critics disagreed if the original, unaltered gameplay held up to modern standards.[38][39]\n\n343 Industries began staffing up their studio while beginning development on the next majorHalotitle, eventually growing to nearly 200,[40]and decided where they wanted to take Master Chief's story over the course of future games.Ryan Paytonwas initially offered the role of creative director, but his ideas for the game did not mesh with the expected first-person shooter focus, and before prototyping was done Payon was replaced and ultimately left in 2011.Josh Holmestook over as creative designer, and the studio shifted focus from ideating to producing the game in earnest. The end result was a more safe, straightforward sequel toHalo 3.[5]Holmes wanted the game's story mode to explore Master Chief's relationship with Cortana, who would break down into adementia-like state.[41]Struggling with making the plot accessible for new players,[40]the team considered dropping the storyline. Holmes, drawing inspiration from his own mother's battle with dementia, insisted it stayed in.[41]\n\nHalo 4was announced atE32011 and released November 6, 2012.[42][43]The game picks up years after the events ofHalo 3, as Master Chief and Cortana fight against a reawakened Forerunner.[citation needed]The game achieved record first-day sales for the franchise.[44]While reviews were generally positive,[45]the story was dinged for being incomprehensible to casual players and relying on knowledge of the wider franchise media.[46]\n\nIntending to create a 10th anniversary edition ofHalo 2, like they had withCombat Evolved, 343 Industries, Saber Interactive, Certain Affinity and other studios collaborated onHalo: The Master Chief Collection, repackingCombat Evolved Anniversary,Halo 2 Anniversary,Halo 3andHalo 4in a single collection for theXbox Oneconsole. The launch was marred with glitches and matchmaking issues, which required numerous patches to fix.[47]Ross apologized to fans for the state of the game, and promised futureHalogames would have public betas.[48]ReachandODSTwere subsequently added to the collection, which was ported to PC and received enhancements for theXbox Series X.[49]\n\n343 Industries' next installment,Halo 5: Guardians, was announced in 2014.[50]The game takes place across many worlds, mainly the Elite homeworld, and revolves around Spartan Locke's hunt for the rogue Master Chief, who is trying to find a still-living Cortana.[51]\n\nThe third part of the Reclaimer Saga,Halo Infinite, was announced duringE3 2018.[52]It brings the focus back to Master Chief, and Halo's roots by taking place on the new Zeta Halo. The story mainly focuses on exploring the deeper lore of theHaloseries, finding what happened to Cortana, and battles with the Banished.[2]It released December 2021.[53]\n\nOn October 6, 2024, 343 Industries unveiled a seven-minute video where they officially announced their rebranding as Halo Studios, while also confirming that multiple new games in the series were currently in development, and that said games would useUnreal Engine 5as opposed to the proprietary Slipspace Engine.[54]Studio head Pierre Hintze explained that the decision to rebrand the studio came from an internal shift in development philosophy behind the franchise, giving the team a \"clean break\" as was the case with transitioning between Bungie and 343.[55]\n\nHaloreturned to its real-time strategy roots withHalo Wars, developed byEnsemble Studiosfor the Xbox 360 and released in 2009. The game takes place 21 years prior to the events ofHalo: Combat Evolved.[citation needed]Ensemble focused their efforts on developing a control scheme that was simple and intuitive for console strategy games, traditionally considered inferior to their keyboard-and-mouse-driven computer game siblings.[citation needed]The game received generally positive reviews from critics,[56]and sold an estimated 2.6 million units, a massive success for the genre on consoles.[57]Halo Warswas Ensemble's last project as a studio before shuttering; post-release updates and content were developed byRobot Entertainment.[58]A sequel,Halo Wars 2, was developed byCreative Assemblyand released on Xbox One and PC platforms simultaneously in February 2017.[57]\n\nInterested in bringingHaloto mobile devices, 343 Industries partnered with Vanguard Games to produceHalo: Spartan Assault, atwin-stick shooterinitially released onWindows 8tablets and phones in 2013; the game later came to the Xbox One andiOSplatforms.[citation needed]Spartan Assaultwas followed by a sequel,Halo: Spartan Strike, in 2015.[59]\n\nOtherHalospinoffs include avirtual realityexperience,Halo Recruit,[60]andHalo: Fireteam Raven, a coin-operatedarcade gamedeveloped byRaw Thrillsand PlayMechanix released in 2018, starting with Round1 USA andDave & Buster'sarcades.[61]Fireteam Raven takes place during the events of Halo: Combat Evolved and puts the players in control of up to four ODST Members battling Covenant forces and the Flood within 6 levels.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2000s, spin-off titles were rumored or pitched for theGame Boy Advance,[62]Gizmondo,[63]Ultra-Mobile PC,[64]andNintendo DS.[65]An episodic video game,Halo: Chronicles, was announced in 2006. To be developed by film director Peter Jackson's Wingnut Interactive, it was canceled as part of budget cuts tied to job layoffs in January 2009.[66]Ensemble Studios developed aHalo-themedmassively multiplayer online game,Titan. The project was canceled internally in 2007–2008, as Microsoft lost interest in a PC-based game.[65][67]Certain Affinity was slated to develop their ownHalotitle, but it was never greenlit because the team was needed to develop the Halo Waypoint online portal instead. AMega Bloks-branded spinoff game, similar to the style ofLego video games, was prototyped for the Xbox 360 but not pursued; footage of the game leaked several years later in 2017.[65]\n\n343 Industries announced afree-to-playHalomultiplayer game for Windows PC,Halo Online, in 2015. The game launched with a closedbeta testlimited to Russia that year. The title was developed with Saber Interactive using modified version of theHalo 3engine, and published by Innova Systems. The project was canceled in August 2016.[65][68]Players modified the game to circumvent the region limitations and add new content after the project's official cancellation.[69]This \"ElDewrito\" project saw legal takedowns from Microsoft for violating its game usage rules.[70]The modders claimed its ElDewrito's popularity hastened Microsoft's plans to release a Windows version ofHalo: The Master Chief Collection, which would later include content fromHalo Online.[71][72]\n\nIn 2006, in acknowledgment of the \"wealth of influences adopted by the Bungie team\", a list of Bungie employees' favorite science fiction material was published on the company's website.[73]The developers acknowledged that theHaloseries' use of ring-shapedmegastructuresfollowed on from concepts featured inLarry Niven'sRingworldandIain M. Banks'Culture series(of whichConsider Phlebas[74]andExcession[73]were said to be particularly influential). In a retrospective article inEdge, Bungie's Jaime Griesemer commented, \"The influence of something likeRingworldisn't necessarily in the design—it's in that feeling of being somewhere else. That sense of scale and an epic story going on out there.\"[74]Griesemer also explained, \"One of the main sources of inspiration wasArmor[byJohn Steakley], in which a soldier has to constantly re-live the same war over and over again. That sense of hopelessness, a relentless battle, was influential.\"[74]The Flood were influenced by the assimilating alien species inChristopher Rowley'sThe Vang;[74]it has also been speculated that the Master Chief's name \"John 117\" may have been a reference to a character named Jon 6725416 in Rowley'sStarhammer,[75]or to the John Spartan character ofDemolition Man.[76]An IGN article exploring the literary influences present in theHalofranchise commented on similarities betweenHaloandOrson Scott Card'sEnder's Game: aspects of theSPARTAN Projectand the design of the Covenant Drones are perceived as reminiscent of the super soldier program and Buggers found in the novel.[75]Bungie has also acknowledgedJames Cameron's filmAliensas a strong cinematic influence.[77]\n\nA report written by Roger Travis and published byThe EscapistcomparesHalowith the Latin epicAeneid, written by classical Roman poetVirgil. Travis posits similarities between the plots of both works and compares the characters present in them, with the Flood and Covenant taking the role performed by the Carthaginians and Master Chief taking the role ofAeneas.[78]\n\nPlayers began creating impromptuHalotournaments and local parties after the release of the first game. Bungie looked at the success of these matches as inspiration for crafting the online multiplayer components ofHalo 2.[79]\n\nLarger organizations soon began operatingHalocompetitive games. In August 2002,G4hosted the Halo National Championship Finals, a FFA [free-for-all] tournament involving sixteen players from across the country (hosted byWil WheatonofStar Trekfame.)[80]The Associates of Gaming Professionals (AGP), which focused solely onHalo, held its first event in November 2002.[81]Inspired by friends placing bets on theirHalomatches, Mike Sepso and Sundance DiGiovanni formedMajor League Gamingthe same year.[82]\n\nMicrosoft and 343 Industries sponsored their own professionalHaloleague, called theHalo Championship Series(HCS), in 2014.[83]It was started in partnership with theElectronic Sports League(ESL). Seasons 1 and 2 ran onThe Master Chief Collection.[84]In August 2015 Microsoft announced it would be increasing the total prize pool of the HCS to US$1 million, for the newly announced Halo World Championship, which will be the debut event forHalo 5.[85]This prize pool was later announced to be crowd-funded, which later resulted inMajor League Gamingannouncing that the prize pool had climbed to US$2 million. Later that week, 343 announced that the prize pool was locked at US$2.5 million. This was the largest console esports prize pool ever.[86]\n\nFirst introduced inHalo 3, Forge is an in-game map editor designed for adjusting weapon, vehicle, and prop placement. While in Editor Mode, the player becomes a floating robot, or \"monitor\", who can spawn, move, and delete any game object on the map. All objects are assigned a monetary value, and cost money to spawn; the level's \"Forge budget\" determines how much money the player can use to spawn objects. As a component ofHalo 3, Forge received critical acclaim upon its release.GameSpot'sJeff Gerstmanndescribed Forge as \"an extremely powerful addition that might just take over your life\", and praised the editor for the replay value it provided.[87]Heather CampbellofPlay MagazinenamedHalo 3her game of the year due to Forge, with co-editor Greg Orlando explaining later in the issue: \"What separatesHalo 3from other console shooters such asCall of Duty 4: Modern WarfareandTeam Fortress 2, though, is the inclusion of a forge mode and the ability to save and edit gameplay films. [...] Although these modes are standard fare in most PC online shooters, their inclusion in a console game is something entirely new – and entirely wonderful.\"[88]In an editorial forEdge, N'Gai Croal stated that Forge could \"help prove the viability ofuser-generated contenton consoles.\"[89]Halo 3's iteration of Forge has received comparisons toGarry's Mod, a 2004Half-Life 2mod with a similar emphasis on free-form construction and experimentation.[90][91][87]\n\nOutside of its intended use as a map editor, Forge has been used to create art installations by arranging in-game props to draw pictures and write messages.[92]Game modes and maps created in Forge have occasionally informed the development ofHaloitself. Grifball, a fictional sport that originated in theHalo-themed web seriesRed vs. Blue, inspired a popular user-created Forge map and game mode styled afterrugby. Grifball was developed into an official weekly playlist forHalo 3, and would go on to be included in every subsequentHalogame afterHalo: Reach.[93]\n\n343 Industries employee Nick Bird, working as Forge Quality Assurance onHalo Infinite, credited Forge for his interest in game development; \"My time in Forge and the Forge community eventually led me to pursue a career in the industry, and ultimately landed me a position to work on what I love in a franchise I love.\"[94]\n\nMartin O'DonnellandMichael Salvatoricollaborated to produce the soundtracks for Bungie'sHalogames. Approached by Bungie to produce something ancient and mysterious forHalo's debut, O'Donnell decided to useGregorian chant, joining in with others to sing the vocal parts.[5]The music was designed to change dynamically based on what was occurring in-game;[95]for a more enjoyable listening experience on the soundtrack releases, O'Donnell arranged the music into standalonesuites.[96]ForHalo 2, the soundtrack included licensed music fromIncubusandBreaking Benjaminalongside the orchestral score; rock guitar virtuoso,Steve Vai, performed various solos throughout the score.[citation needed]\n\nForHalo 3, O'Donnell noted he wanted to bring back the themes from the original game to help tie together the end of the trilogy.[97]The tracks are presented, similarly to theprevious soundtrack forHalo 2,[98]in a suite form. Unlike previous soundtracks, where much of the music had been synthesized on computer, the soundtrack forHalo 3was recorded using a 60-piece orchestra, along with a 24-voice chorus.[99][100][101]A soundtrack forHalo 3: ODSTwas released alongside the game and included many of the tracks from the game.[102]For Bungie's last game in the Halo series,Halo: Reach, Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori returned to compose the soundtrack. O'Donnell wrote \"somber, more visceral\" music to reflect the darker nature of the campaign and style of the game. As Bungie had been makingHalo 3: ODSTandHalo: Reachat the same time, Martin O'Donnell had also been composing the soundtracks at the same time, but production for the music ofHalo: Reachdid not begin until after the release ofHalo 3: ODST.[citation needed]\n\nThe music ofHalohelped spur a renewed interest in chant music.[103]\n\nForHalo Wars, the task of creating the game's music fell toStephen Rippy. Rippy listened to O'Donnell's soundtracks for inspiration and incorporated theHalotheme into parts of his arrangements. In addition to synthesized and orchestral components, the composer focused on the choir and piano as essential elements, feeling these were important in creating the \"Halosound\".[104]\n\nThe music ofHalo 4was composed byNeil Davidgeand Kazuma Jinnouchi. TheHalo 4 Original Soundtrackwas released on October 22, 2012, followed by a two-disc Special Edition on November 6. Neil Davidge served as an out-of-house composer for 343 Industries which proved to be very expensive leading Kazuma Jinnouchi to take over the responsibility of music production forHalo 5: Guardians. The music by Neil Davidge and Kazuma Jinnouchi forHalo 4received mixed reviews, being recognized as creative music but too different from the original Halo formula. Jinnouchi returned to compose the music forHalo 5: Guardians.\n\nIn 2017, 343 Industries andCreative Assemblyreleased a sequel toHalo WarstitledHalo Wars 2. The soundtrack was composed byGordy Haab, Brian Lee White and Brian Trifon under the direction of Paul Lipson who had helped in the audio and music of nearly every previous Halo title. TheHalo Wars 2soundtrack featured many melodies from the music that Stephen Rippy had composed for the firstHalo Warsbut with new arrangements and more melodies to represent the individual characters. The original game soundtrack was released on February 17, 2017, and released digitally on February 21, 2017.\n\nThe music forHalo Infinitewas a collaboration betweenGareth Coker, Curtis Schweitzer,Joel Corelitz, Alex Bhore, and Eternal Time & Space, overseen by 343 Industries Music Supervisor Joel Yarger.Infinite's soundtrack was released digitally on December 8, 2021, in two albums, one covering the score for the campaign, and another covering the music for the game's multiplayer component.\n\nTheHalofranchise includes various types of merchandise and adaptations outside of the video games. This includes bestselling novels, graphic novels, and other licensed products, from action figures to a packaging tie-in withMountain Dew.[citation needed]Numerous action figures and vehicles based onHalohave been produced. Joyride Studios createdHaloandHalo 2action figures, whileHalo 3poseable and collectible action figures, aimed at collectors, were produced byMcFarlane Toysand became some of the top-selling action figures of 2007 and 2008.[105]MEGA Blokshas partnered with Microsoft to produceHalo-themed toys.[106]\n\nAs part of Microsoft's multimedia efforts, Microsoft Studios decided to create a tie-in novel forCombat Evolved.Eric NylundwroteHalo: The Fall of Reachin seven weeks, and it was published in October 2001.[citation needed]Nylund would write additionalHaloworks including the novelsFirst Strike(2003) andGhosts of Onyx(2006).[citation needed]The game itself was turned into a novelization byWilliam C. Dietzin 2003, calledHalo: The Flood.[citation needed]Other novels have been written byJoseph Staten(Contact Harvest),Tobias S. Buckell,Karen Traviss,Greg Bear(The Forerunner Saga),Matt Forbeck,John Shirley,Troy Denning,Cassandra Rose Clarke, andKelly Gay.[107]\n\nA collection ofHaloshort stories,Halo: Evolutions, was simultaneously released in print and audiobook formats in November 2009.Evolutionsincludes original material by Nylund, Buckell, Traviss, and contributions from Bungie.[108]Tor re-released the first threeHalonovels with new content and cover art.[109]Another collection,Halo: Fractures, compiled new and previously released short fiction in 2016.[110]\n\nTheHalouniverse was adapted into comics in 2006 with the release ofThe Halo Graphic Novel, a collection of fourshort storiespublished byMarvel Comics. Marvel produced a number of otherHalocomic series.Halo: Uprising, byBrian Michael BendisandAlex Maleev, bridges the gap between the events ofHalo 2andHalo 3;[111]initially planned to conclude shortly before the release ofHalo 3in 2007, delays led to the final issue being published April 2009.[citation needed]Two additional comic runs were announced in 2009.[112]Peter David's series,Halo: Helljumper, is set prior toHalo: Combat Evolvedand focuses on the elite Orbital Drop Shock Troopers. The five-part series was published between July and November 2009.[113]Fred Van Lente's series,Halo: Blood Line, revolves around a black ops team of Spartan supersoldiers assigned to the UNSC Office of Naval Intelligence,[114]and debuted in December 2009.[115]Marvel also released a three-part comic adaptation of the novelHalo: The Fall of Reachin 2011.[116]\n\nDark Horse Comics has produced a number ofHaloseries, beginning with the three-part seriesHalo: Initiation, released in August 2013.[117]Also announced wasHalo: Escalation, an ongoing comic series covering the period directly afterHalo 4; it ran for 24 issues from 2013 to 2015.[118][citation needed]\n\nIn 2005,Columbia Picturespresident Peter Schlessel began working outside the studio system to produce aHalofilm adaptation.Alex Garlandwrote a script,[119]which was then pitched to studios by couriers dressed as Master Chief. Microsoft's terms required $10 million against 15 percent of gross; most studios passed, citing the lack of risk for Microsoft compared to their large share of potential profits.20th Century FoxandUniversal Picturesdecided to partner to produce the film, paying Microsoft $5 million to option the film and 10 percent of grosses.[120]Peter Jacksonwas slated to be the executive producer,[121]withNeill Blomkampas director. Before Blomkamp signed on,Guillermo del Torowas in negotiations to direct.[122]\n\nD. B. WeissandJosh Olsonrewrote Garland's script during 2006.[123]Pre-production of the film was halted and restarted several times.[124]Later that year, 20th Century Fox threatened to pull out of the project, leading Universal to issue an ultimatum to Jackson and Schlessel: either reduce their large\"first-dollar\"revenue deals, or the project was ended. Both refused, and the project stalled.[120]Blomkamp would produce a series of live-action shorts as promotion forHalo 3, collectively titledHalo: Landfall.[125]The rights for the film reverted to Microsoft.[126]\n\nHalo 4: Forward Unto Dawnis a live-action film and miniseries set in the Halo universe. Although shot as a feature-length film,Forward Unto Dawnwas originally released as a webseries consisting of five episodes released between October 5, 2012, and November 2, 2012. The series' plot, occurring in the early days of the Human-Covenant War, revolves around Thomas Lasky, a young cadet at Corbulo Academy of Military Science, and how John-117 inspired him to eventually become a leader. Lasky is also a prominent character inHalo 4as a commander on the UNSC Infinity. The name of the series, aside from being a reference to the UNSC frigateForward Unto Dawn, is given new significance in the series as part of a running motif based on a poem. The film cut was released on Blu-ray and DVD on December 4, 2012.\n\nOn April 3, 2014, it was announced thatRidley Scottand his production company,Scott Free Productions, were working on aHalodigital feature alongside 343 Industries andXbox Entertainment Studios; Scott would be the executive producer, withDavid W. ZuckerandSergio Mimica-Gezzanas the directors. The feature was expected to follow the same format as Machinima'sHalo 4: Forward Unto Dawn.[127]On June 9, 2014, it was announced at E3 2014 that the feature, titledHalo: Nightfall, would be included withHalo: The Master Chief Collectionat its November 2014 launch. The feature introduces a new character to the franchise, Agent Jameson Locke, played by actorMike Colter;Nightfallis considered to be his origin story.[128]Locke is one of the Spartans portrayed on the cover art and plays a large role in the series.[129]On July 24, 2014, 343 Industries released the first trailer for the feature.[130]Halo: Nightfallis available to watch through Halo Channel, an application for the Xbox One, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone.[131]On March 16, 2015, the series became available to stream, download, and buy on physical disc.[132]\n\nOn May 21, 2013,Xbox Entertainment Studiosand 343 announced that a live-action television show ofHalowould be produced withSteven Spielbergserving as executive producer through what is nowAmblin Television.

Martens also felt that the series sacrificed some of the \"silliness\" from the games.[59]Marcus Lehto, one of the co-creators ofHalo: Combat Evolved(2001), stated that the show is \"not theHaloI made\", but later stated that he \"never said [he] didn't like it\".[60]\n\nThe second season received a more positive reception from critics,[55]with some declaring it to be a big improvement over the first season.[61][62]Hayden Mears of IGN gave a 7/10 rating to the second season's first four episodes, stating that the season is \"leagues more coherent and inspired than the first\".[63]\n\nMaster Chiefhas been described as acting out of character compared to his core canon counterpart,[59]and Kwan Ha, an original character created for the Silver Timeline canon, has received negative reception due to her story being perceived as too \"disjointed\" and \"divorced\" from the main plotline of the series and theHalouniverse.[64][65][66]\n\nThesex scenebetween Master Chief/John and Makee, another major original character created for the Silver Timeline canon, in the eighth episode of the first season, has received a polarized reaction from audiences and critics alike; discussions have included whether the scene was \"contrived and forced\",[67]whether Master Chief commits awar crimeby having sex with aprisoner of warwho is unable to properly provide herconsent, and whether this is atypical behavior of Master Chief in comparison to the core canon (this is the first time John has sex in either the core or Silver canons).[68]\n\nKiki Wolfkill, the studio head oftransmediaat343 Industriesand an executive producer of the show, defended the addition of the scene, stating that while the creative team had \"a lot of conversation leading up to whether to do that or not and... there's a lot of different opinions and voices\", that the scene was necessary in order to humanize John by providing him with \"a human connection with someone\" in order to end the season with him as \"a fully defined character\".[69]\n\nMaster Chief actor Pablo Schreiber, on the other hand, has described the inclusion of this scene as \"a huge mistake\", adding that he argued against it at the time but that his opinion was ignored.[70]",

Anyone is welcome to participate in the project!\n\nA small sampling of articles in need of new content:\n\nThe following articles forHalomedia could use the addition (or completion) of aplot synopsis:\n\nSupernal Spiral-class keyships were crafted by the Forerunner Builders and used by Lifeworkers to collect specimens, transport them to Installation 00, and then distribute them across the galaxy to reseed it with life following the activation of the Halo Array. As indicated by their classification, these vessels also act as keys to activate slipspace portals that are strategically-positioned throughout the Milky Way. Despite their mission of peace, these keyships are heavily armed and impressively durable. One of these vessels, theAnodyne Spirit, had crashed on the San'Shyuum homeworld of Janjur Qom, eventually becoming the centerpoint of their religion and later the literal centerpoint of High Charity following the formation of the Covenant.\n\nThis galaxy is vast; its wonders and beauty are almost unfathomable. But the galaxy also hides dark secrets, some of which have lain dormant since the beginning of time itself. There is a danger in secrets, both in seeking and in knowing. Some things are meant to be hidden from view. Some mysteries defy understanding, and sometimes even the things we think we know are untrue. Some secrets should remain untouched.—Cortana,Origins",
